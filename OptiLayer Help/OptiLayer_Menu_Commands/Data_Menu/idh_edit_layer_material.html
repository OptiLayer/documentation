<p>The Layer Material and Substrate/Incident/Exit Medium dialog
windows assist in creating and modifying database files that
describe the optical properties of Layer Materials and Substrates.
The header of the dialog window indicates which material is
currently being edited. In the screenshot below, the data file for
the material “QUARTZ Disp. Data” in the Substrate database is
being displayed.
An isotropic material is defined by its complex refractive index,
which comprises a real refractive index Re(n) and an imaginary
component Im(n) that represents absorption (commonly referred to
as the extinction coefficient).</p>
<p>To create a data file and set material optical properties in table
format (located under the Table tab of the window), begin by
entering the desired number of spectral points at which you wish
to define the material refractive index in the ‘Spectral points’
field. For materials that are not dispersive, only one point is
required.
To input a refractive index value, select a cell in the Re(n)
column and utilize standard editing options. To specify an
extinction coefficient value, select a cell in the Im(n) column.
For ease of editing, utilize the / <a class="reference external" href="idh_spreadsheet_editing.html">Spreadsheet Editing
Tools</a>, which can be accessed
through the Menu, Toolbar, or by using hotkeys.
If you prefer to specify the refractive index using δ values (δ =
1 - Re(n)), particularly relevant for EUV and X-ray applications,
you can switch between these conventions using the specialized
combo box found in the caption of the Re(n) column.
This allows for seamless modification of optical properties based
on your specific requirements.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/DB_layerMaterial_12.png" /></p>
<p>In the Layer Material Editor, the extinction coefficient Im(n) can
also be specified as the Absorption coefficient. The definition
for the Absorption coefficient is as follows: Absorption
coefficient = 4π Im(n)/λ.
This formula allows you to calculate and input the Absorption
coefficient based on the provided values for Im(n) and the
wavelength (λ). This feature provides an additional method for
defining and adjusting the optical properties of the material
within the Layer Material Editor.</p>
<p>./ <img alt="image3" src="../../_images/DB_layerMaterial_13.png" /></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When working with substrates, the extinction coefficient Im(n)
can be specified in the units of Internal Transmittance or
Optical Density. These settings can be controlled through a
specialized combo box, as displayed in the figure below.
For accurate measurement and calculation, the thickness of the
test sample is critical when using Internal Transmittance or
Optical Density units. You can specify the thickness of the
sample in the provided Thickness entry field.</div>

<p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/edmat_tab.png" /></p>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" />/  If the value of Thickness is changed, the Internal
transmittance will be recalculated using the updated thickness
value. This revised thickness value will then be utilized as the
default setting in other Substrate and Layer Material Editors.</p>
<p><img alt="image9" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" />/  It is possible to specify Im(n) &lt; 0 values (an
optically active substrate). For this purpose activate the
corresponding option using right-click menu.</p>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="formula">Formula</p>
<p>Another method to specify material properties is by utilizing the
Formula tab within the edit dialog windows.</p>
<p><img alt="image10" src="../../_images/DB_layerMaterial_21.png" /></p>
<p>When working with material properties in the software, users have
the option to select different formulas to describe the refractive
index (Re(n)) or extinction coefficient (Im(n)) of a material. If
a formula for either Re(n) or Im(n) is chosen on the Formula page,
the corresponding column in the Table page will be grayed out and
unavailable for editing.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="composition">Composition</p>
<p>You can create Composite materials, which are combinations of
different materials from the current database, available under the
Composition tab in the edit dialog windows. The refractive index
of a composite material can be determined using the average
weighted value of the dielectric permittivities, Bruggemann’s
formula, or the average weighted value of refractive indices. It
is possible to blend up to 5 distinct materials to form any
Composite material. It is important to note that only materials
defined through the Table or Formula tabs can be utilized to
specify a Composite material.</p>
<p><img alt="image14" src="../../_images/DB_layerMaterial_31.png" /></p>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="changeable">Changeable</p>
<p>OptiLayer offers the capability to utilize what are known as
Changeable materials. These are artificial materials whose
refractive indices and/or extinction coefficients can be adjusted
during the optimization process, accessible through the Changeable
tab in the edit dialog window. The Changeable tab feature is
exclusively available within the Layer Material database.
Employing Changeable materials facilitates index optimization,
significantly broadening the possibilities for experimenting with
optimizations of the merit function.</p>
<p><img alt="image15" src="../../_images/edmat_changeable.png" /></p>
<p>The “Changeable” check box activates the option to modify material
properties. It is required to set the boundaries within which the
material’s refractive index and extinction coefficient can vary,
as well as their initial values. The “Change” column indicates the
nature of permissible changes:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Fixed implies that the specific value remains constant and
does not undergo alteration.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Per Material signifies that the refractive indices/extinction
coefficients of all layers labeled with the material’s
abbreviation will change in unison, effectively treating them
as a single value.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Per Layer indicates that the refractive index/extinction
coefficients of each marked layer can vary independently from
one another.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changeable materials are compatible with the “Refinement” and
“Needle Optimization” features. It’s important to note that when
using these options, the values of the refractive indices and
extinction coefficients are included in the current design file
and may be stored within the design database. The <a class="reference external" href="idh_design_editor.html">Design
Editor</a> includes a supplementary tab
dedicated to editing the values of refractive indices and
extinction coefficients.
Additionally, there is a type of material known as Changeable
Composition. This category serves as a blend between Changeable
and Composite materials. A Changeable Composition material is
configurable when its corresponding checkbox is selected, offering
a dynamic approach to material composition within design
optimization processes.</p>
<p><img alt="image16" src="../../_images/edchangecomposition.png" /></p>
<p>A Changeable Composition material is defined as a blend of two
materials: High Material and Low Material, which can be selected
from the current Material database. The variable parameter is the
proportion of High Material in the mixture. During synthesis
procedures, this proportion operates as an optimization parameter,
in a manner similar to the refractive index value in Changeable
type materials (as mentioned previously). For a Changeable
Composition material, one can specify the limits, starting value,
and change type for this fraction.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="thickvar">ThickVar</p>
<p>ThickVar materials possess optical properties that vary with the
thickness of the layer. A common example of this type of material
is metal-island films. Typically, the optical properties of such
materials are determined for several characteristic thicknesses
through characterization. It is assumed that these properties are
stored in the Layer Material database, with the names reflecting
these thicknesses for convenience.
A ThickVar material is constructed as a collection of these
material files. In this assembly, the corresponding thickness is
indicated in the second column, while the names of the files are
listed in the first one:</p>
<p><img alt="image20" src="../../_images/matthickvar.png" /></p>
<p>There are two distinct categories of ThickVar material, each
defined by how the refractive index interacts with the physical
characteristics of the layer:
1. Constant: In this type, the refractive index remains constant
throughout the coating and is not influenced by the coating’s
vertical position or coordinate. However, the specific value of
the refractive index of a ThickVar layer is determined by the
Thickness parameter. This type aptly describes the behavior of
metal-island films, where the optical properties do not vary with
position within the film but depend significantly on the volume or
amount of material deposited. This reflects situations where the
material’s behavior is homogeneous across the layer but varies
according to how thick the layer is.
2. Profile: Unlike the Constant type, the refractive index in this
case varies according to the coating’s coordinate. The refractive
index for a Profile ThickVar material is determined based on two
parameters: the coordinate ‘z’ (which represents depth or vertical
position within the coating) and the wavelength ‘λ’. Essentially,
the spreadsheet defining a Profile ThickVar material presents how
the refractive index changes with depth into the material and with
wavelength. The overall thickness of the layer dictates which
segment of this defined refractive index profile is utilized for
the current layer, offering a nuanced approach to modeling how the
optical properties of a material can vary with depth and
wavelength simultaneously.</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><img alt="image23" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /></p></td>
<td><p>Note: For all instances, linear interpolation is
utilized to ascertain values within the provided grids
for wavelength and thickness. In situations where a
needed value falls outside the established bounds of
the spreadsheet, those values are perpetuated as
constants—specifically, they are extended to match the
nearest available value documented within the
spreadsheet. This approach is known as constant
extrapolation.</p></td>

</div>
<p> Inhomogeneity</p>
<p>The Inhomogeneity tab within the Layer Material Editor provides
the functionality to define the degree of inhomogeneity for a
material. This parameter can be determined and saved by OptiChar
as an outcome of the Layer Characterization process, using the
linear inhomogeneity model. Alternatively, users have the option
to manually input this value. It is important to note that the
inhomogeneity level set in this manner applies uniformly to all
layers made of this material, regardless of their individual
thicknesses.</p>
<p><img alt="image24" src="../../_images/matinh1.png" /></p>
<p>The definition of the Inhomogeneity Level is:</p>
<p>where n2 and n1 are refractive indices at the top and bottom
boundaries of the layer and is the averaged refractive index.</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, this Inhomogeneity level serves as the default layer
inhomogeneity whenever the design’s inhomogeneity is connected to
this material (refer to <a class="reference external" href="idh_design_editor.html">Design Editor</a>
description). Calculations involving Inhomogeneity factors are
executed solely when the / <a class="reference external" href="idh_data_display_modes.html">Inhomogeneities/Interlayers
option</a> is active.</p>
<p>Preview</p>
<p>To swiftly verify the material parameters inputted in the Layer
Material and Substrate/Incident/Exit Medium dialog windows,
utilizing the Preview tab within these windows proves to be
convenient.</p>
<p><img alt="image25" src="../../_images/DB_layerMaterial_41.png" /></p>
<p>The Options button or the right-click menu offers functionalities
to execute transformations among table, formula, and composite
material presentations:</p>
