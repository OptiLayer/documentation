<p>Describing design structures using formulas is commonly convenient
and recognized, especially when specifying layer optical
thicknesses in quarter-wave units. In these formulas, the
materials of the layers are represented by their
<a class="reference external" href="idh_material_abbreviations.html">abbreviations.</a> An example
of such a formula would include:</p>
<p>H 0.5L 2H L</p>
<p>corresponds to a 4-layer design where the optical thicknesses of
the layers are equal to 1, 0.5, 2, and 1 in Quarter-Wave Optical
Thickness (QWOT) units, respectively. In such depictions, the
factor 1 can be omitted for simplification.
When a specific sequence of layers is repeated within the design,
this repetition is typically indicated by using a power index. The
OptiLayer Formula Editor, a tool designed for editing and creating
layer structure formulas, supports this notation. It recognizes a
power index, written as ^n, following a group of layers enclosed
in brackets to denote repetition. For example, the formula</p>
<p>(H L)^4 H</p>
<p>corresponds to a 9-layer design in which the sequence of layers
represented as (H L)—where “H” might stand for a high refractive
index material and “L” for a low refractive index material—is
repeated 4 times, followed by an additional layer. This notation
simplifies the depiction of repetitive layer structures in optical
design formulas.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../../../_images/Design_formula_11.png" /></p>
<p>You can utilize the Formula Editor located in the second tab of
the Design editor window both to create a new design formula and
to alter an existing one.
If the “Start from the substrate” box is checked, the layer
sequence is configured to begin from the substrate side.
Conversely, if your layer ordering convention begins from the
ambient medium, you should uncheck this box.
The “Allow two-character abbreviations” checkbox enables a more
complex mode that accepts two-character abbreviations for material
identifiers. To ensure accurate formula parsing in this mode,
different material abbreviations must be separated by spaces.
The “Spreadsheet to Formula” button transforms the current design
displayed in the Spreadsheet tab into a formulaic representation.
The “Formula to Design” button applies updates to the actual
design thicknesses if the formula is correctly input.
OptiLayer retains a record of all edited designs throughout a
session. If you wish to review or modify previous design formulas,
you can do so by selecting them from the list box located at the
bottom of the window.
To confirm and implement changes to the design, press the OK
button. If the formula entered cannot be recognized as a valid
design, you will be prompted either to adjust the formula or to
cancel and discard the changes by selecting the Cancel button.</p>
