<p>The Design Editor enables direct editing of a design in memory
(refer to the section on <a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_design.html">Modifying
Design</a>) or within the Design database.</p>

<p>Use the “Number of layers” field to adjust the number of layers in
a design. Newly added layers are assigned a default thickness of
one quarter-wavelength and are given a material according to the
preferences set in the “Materials” field. The maximum number of
layers that can be used in OptiLayer is mainly limited only by the
computer’s performance and memory size, which is currently 65536.
The “Control wavelength” field is used to correlate the physical
thickness of a given design to its optical thicknesses. This
correlation is based on the refractive indices of materials loaded
into memory, the match angle value, and the match medium
refractive index, and is defined as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../../_images/des_form1.gif" /></p>
<p>Here, Q represents the thickness in quarter-wave optical thickness
(QWOT) units, λ0 <em>is the control wavelength, θm</em> is the match
angle, n(λ0) <em>is the material’s refractive index at the control
wavelength, nm</em> is the refractive index of the match medium,
and d is the physical thickness. It is important to note that
altering the control wavelength modifies the physical thickness
but leaves the optical, full-wave optical thickness (FWOT), and
QWOT thicknesses unchanged (provided the “Keep physical thickness”
box is unchecked). If the goal is to maintain the physical
thickness of the design layers, simply adjust the state of the
“Keep physical thickness” option.
The “Match angle” field enables you to accurately adjust physical
thicknesses to optical thicknesses at oblique angles of incidence.
How thicknesses will change when varying the “Match Angle”
parameter once again depends on the state of the “Keep physical
thickness” option.
The “Match medium” field permits the change of the incident
medium’s refractive index used for matching physical thicknesses
to optical thicknesses. You can enter its value manually, or opt
to use the incident medium refractive index that is loaded into
memory. Press the “Use loaded” button to populate this entry with
the current control wavelength’s incident medium refractive index.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The first four columns of the table are meticulously designed to
represent layer thicknesses in varied forms. Values in these
columns are interlinked, ensuring that any change in one
automatically propagates corresponding adjustments across the
remaining three.</div>
</div>
<p>The Physical Thickness column showcases the layer’s thickness in
metric units (micrometers, nanometers, or Angstroms), which can be
set in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_units.html">Units page</a> of the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_configuration.html">Configuration menu</a>. The values here
are deduced from the optical thickness calculations.</p>

<p>Optical Thickness represents the product of the physical
thickness and the refractive index at the specified control
wavelength. Displayed in metric units, which are configurable
in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_configuration.html">Configuration menu</a>,
optical thickness is fundamental to any OptiLayer design.</p>

<p>In the Material column, you input character
<a class="reference external" href="idh_material_abbreviations.html">abbreviations</a>  to
identify layer materials. These materials, once loaded into
memory, are selectable from the <a class="reference external" href="idh_general_information_window.html">General Information

modified via the <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_material.html">Materials
page</a> of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options.html">Options
dialog</a>. The physical thickness
calculation for a layer is based on the corresponding
material’s refractive index if its abbreviation matches a
material in memory. Note, optical, FWOT, and QWOT thickness
measurements remain unaffected by material choice. An alert
will be triggered if a non-existing material abbreviation is
attempted to be added to the design.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="idh_layer_status.html">Status</a>
<a class="reference external" href="idh_layer_status.html">column</a> enables control over the
layer thickness during the optimization process. Selecting
“A” (Active) allows the corresponding layer thickness to be
modified during optimization, whereas “B” (Fixed) will keep
the layer thickness constant.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Glue Layers checkbox is a feature that enables users to
control the automatic merging of adjacent layers made from the
same material. If you employ the Formula tab to input a formula
that results in the creation of multiple adjacent layers of the
same material, activating this option can be beneficial to prevent
the accumulation of an excessive number of layers that don’t add
any unique physical properties to the design.
Conversely, there are circumstances where you might prefer to keep
layers separate, even if they are made of the same material. This
is particularly true if the material in question has a variable or
adjustable composition index on a per-layer basis. In such cases,
despite sharing an abbreviation, different layers can exhibit
varied refractive indices. Another scenario involves rugate and
rugate-like coatings, which consist of numerous thin layers
designated by the same abbreviation, yet their refractive indices
are dictated by the Fraction parameter of the associated material.
By default, the Glue Layers option is enabled. This means that
OptiLayer will automatically consolidate adjacent layers composed
of the same material into a single layer, with the total thickness
being the sum of all individual layers combined. This automatic
merging is a common procedure during the synthesis process,
streamlining the design by reducing redundancy without
compromising the overall structure’s efficacy.</p>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="summary">Summary</p>
<p>Pressing the small “Σ” button opens an additional Summary window,
which provides more detailed information regarding the total
values in the current design:</p>

<p>In the Design Summary window, you can view the total values
corresponding to the material of each layer within the design.</p>

<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="refractive-indices">Refractive Indices</p>
<p>When utilizing materials with changeable properties, it is
possible to edit the values of refractive indices and extinction
coefficients through the “Refractive Indices” tab within the
Design Editor.
<img alt="image4" src="../../../_images/Refractive_indices11.png" /></p>
<p>Values that cannot be altered are displayed with disabled
attributes, indicating that they are fixed. You are only able to
modify values that correspond to materials designated with the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_layer_material.html">Per Layer changeable</a> status.
This status detail can be further explored in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_layer_material.html">Editing Layer
Material</a> topic. Additionally,
if a material with a “Changeable Composition” and “Per Layer”
status is present within the design, it is the Fraction values
that can be edited, as opposed to the refractive index and
extinction coefficient values.</p>
<p>Preview</p>
<p>The Preview tab provides a view of the refractive index profile of
your design, where thickness is consistently represented in
Quarter-Wave Optical Thickness (QWOT) units.</p>
<p>For convenient editing access, you can utilize any of the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_spreadsheet_editing.html">Spreadsheet Editing Tools</a>
available from the main toolbox, the toolbar, or by using the
corresponding keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, the Reverse Layers
command found in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_edit.html">Edit Menu</a> allows you
to invert the layer order in your design.
To confirm and apply any edits, click the OK button. If you wish
to discard all changes and exit the Design editor, simply click
the Cancel button.</p>
