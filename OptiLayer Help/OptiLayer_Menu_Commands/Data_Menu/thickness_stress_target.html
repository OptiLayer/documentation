<p>The Thickness/Stress targets enable users to define the desired
total thickness of the coating or the total thicknesses for each
material type. These requirements can be expressed in a broad
manner, represented as a linear combination of the total
thicknesses of each coating material (<em>SThabbr</em>) with Material
coefficients <em>Ci</em>j  of arbitrary values.</p>
<p> C1H SThH + C1L SThL + … = Tg1 ,</p>
<p> C2H SThH + C2L SThL + … = Tg2 ,</p>
<p> …            …             …         …</p>
<p>The familiar Stoney formula, which relates surface deflection to
layer thicknesses, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio of the
materials, and stresses in the layer materials, can be
conveniently reformulated in the mentioned format. For a practical
demonstration, you can refer to <a class="reference external" href="example_44_oic_2013.html">Example
44</a>.</p>
<p>As is customary, a merit function linked to stresses is introduced
in the context of this formulation:</p>
<p> MF2stress = wstress [(Tg1 - S1)2 + (Tg2 - S2)2 + … ] ,</p>
<p>represent the desired targets for each of the linear combinations.
It is also possible to create asymmetrical target expressions
using <a class="reference external" href="idh_target_qualifier.html">Qualifiers</a> A, B, and range
targets (<a class="reference external" href="idh_target_qualifier.html">Qualifier</a> R).</p>
<p>The most basic Thickness/Stress target can be automatically
generated by utilizing the “New” button in the Thickness/Stress
<a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_database.html">Database</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/thstress_1.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, only one target expression is specified in the
Thickness/Stress Target number entry field. The default number of
coatings is set to 1.
For the specified target value of 1000, in this example, it is in
nanometers based on the current <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_units.html">Length
Units</a>. The Tolerance value is also
given as 100 nanometers. All Material coefficients are set at
1.00, making the linear combination straightforward as the total
physical thickness of the coating.
It is important to note that more complex requirements can be
formulated using the Stoney formula and the mechanical properties
of layer materials.
In situations where Back Design is used or a Stack object is
loaded in memory, it is possible to create Thickness/Stress
Targets for multiple coatings. By adjusting the number of coatings
entry field to 2, you will receive the default Thickness/Stress
Target in the specified form.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/thstress_2.png" /></p>
<p>When additional coatings are known and loaded into memory, their
names will appear in the “Names” column. By default, the
coefficients for the second coatings are set to -1.00, not +1.00.
This negates the contribution of the second coating to stresses,
following a common stress compensation technique where a similar
coating is deposited on the backside of the substrate, effectively
balancing stresses and minimizing substrate deflection. This
technique is advantageous as it does not necessitate detailed
knowledge of material mechanical properties.
For a more reliable stress target that prevents potential
imbalances in layer materials content in the forward and back
coatings, the following approach is recommended:</p>

<p>In this scenario, two requirements are being specified:</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>The total thickness of the material H should be as close as
possible to 0.0,</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>The total thickness of the material L should be as close as
possible to 0.0.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

recommend referring to <a class="reference external" href="example_44_oic_2013.html">Example
44</a> for further discussion.</p>
