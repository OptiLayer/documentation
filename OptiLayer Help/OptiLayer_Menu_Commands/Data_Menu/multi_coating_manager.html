<p>In order to design complex multi-mirror systems such as dispersive
mirrors, pulse compressors, and other elements of ultrafast
optics, one needs to consider and optimize systems consisting of
several mirrors.
For examples, you can refer to the papers:</p>

<p>First of all, it is necessary to activate the Multi-Coating Mode
in OptiLayer; otherwise, all other controls are locked.
In Multi-Coating Mode, all other controls become available for
editing.</p>

<table class="docutils align-default">

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /></p></td>

<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="complementary-pair-configuration">Complementary pair configuration</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/multcoat_2.png" /></p>
<p>This configuration describes a complementary pair of mirrors
working at the same angle of incidence, specified in the Resulting
Target file.
The number of coatings specifies how many mirrors are considered
in this configuration. In the case of a double-angle
configuration, this number includes the reflection from a similar
window at a different angle of incidence. This number can range
from 2 up to 10 in the current version. Once this number is
specified, the Multi-Coating Manager is redisplayed with the
required number of sub-panels.
In each panel, you could specify:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Substrate (select one from the Substrate database)</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Design (select one from the Design database)</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>optional Target (select one from the Target database if
necessary). These targets are used to avoid large
oscillations in individual reflection curves, and the
corresponding weight should usually be less than 1.0, with
levels of 0.05 being quite reasonable.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[…] button to the right of the Design name opens the local
<a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_design.html">Design Editor</a>, allowing you to
edit each design’s thicknesses directly in memory without saving
the designs to the Design database.
The optimization target should be specified in the Resulting
Target entry field. It uses the efficient values of R and Phase
characteristics:   RƩ = (R1ˑR2ˑ…ˑRp)1/p, and PhaseƩ = (Phase1 +
Phase2 + … + Phasep) / p. Phase characteristics can include just
phase, or GD, or GDD. This convention is convenient as it reduces
the total performance of the whole system to a single bounce.
The Reload check box instructs the Multi-Coating Manager to reload
a design from the database if the OK or Update buttons are
clicked.
The Plot check box activates the presentation of individual
Reflectance and Phase curves in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation
windows</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if individual plots are selected for this
configuration, we obtain:</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../../_images/multcoat_evr.png" /></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../../_images/multcoat_evgdd.png" /></p>
<p>These evaluation windows clearly demonstrate how this
complementary pair suppresses the oscillation of each of the
mirrors in the resulting GDD performance.</p>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="double-angle-configuration">Double-angle configuration</p>
<p>For the double-angle configuration, it is necessary to disable the
Master check box on the second sub-panel of the dialog. In this
case, Design 2 will be a Slave design, meaning that its layer
thicknesses are entirely defined by the thicknesses of the first
Master design to the left.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../../_images/multcoat_doubleang1.png" /></p>
<p>It is possible to adjust the Slave design proportion of
thicknesses expressed as a percentage in the Current field. If a
range of values for the Current is specified (From and To fields),
the Current proportion value will be included in the Refinement
procedure. This case can be considered as the simultaneous
deposition of both mirrors in the same run using well-calibrated
and properly adjusted differences in deposition rates in different
positions in the chamber, for example.
If all proportions (Current, From, and To) are zeroes, the
thicknesses of the Slave design are exactly equal to the
thicknesses of the Master design.
The Override Angle check boxes activate the use of angles of
incidence different from those specified in the Resulting Target.
The values of angles are entered into the related entry fields and
then used during the calculation of the reflection at each mirror.
In this way, the double-angle case can be described.
The Override Bounces option allows for the change in the number of
reflections from each of the mirrors. This option is sometimes
required for the design of complex dispersive mirror compressors.
One of the double-angle solutions is shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="image9" src="../../_images/multcoat_doubleang2.png" /></p>
<p>Note that in this case, only one mirror cross-section is displayed
in the design bar. The oscillation of GDD on each reflection is
efficiently suppressed by the utilization of the angular shift in
the double-angle configuration.</p>
