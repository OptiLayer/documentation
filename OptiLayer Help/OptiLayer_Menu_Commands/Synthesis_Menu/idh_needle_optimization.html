and is especially useful for solving complicated design problems.
Needle optimization involves inserting new layers into the
optimized design, typically thin needle-like variations of the
refractive index profile. During the needle optimization process,
a plot of a special function (the P-function) is displayed on the
screen, with the best insertion point being where the P-function
has its largest negative value. In automatic mode, the program
automatically identifies this point and computes an optimal
thickness for the new layer.
The material for a new layer inserted during the needle
optimization process is selected based on certain rules. In a
two-component coating, the material for the new layer differs from
the material of the existing layer where the insertion occurs. For
coatings with more than two materials, the optimal material is
chosen from those designated as Active (A) or Exclusionary (E) in
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_material.html">Materials window</a>.</p>
<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="needle-optimization-auto"><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/need_auto_btn.png" /> Needle Optimization AUTO</p>
<p>If you start the needle optimization process by choosing the
Needle optimization AUTO option, an automatic procedure is
invoked. This involves a series of alternating needle variation
and refinement steps. The process continues until it is no longer
possible to insert a new layer that would enhance the current
design. This stopping criterion is based on either a negligible
improvement in the merit function or obtaining a positive
P-function value within all layers of the current design. This
indicates that an optimal solution for a coating with the current
total optical thickness has been achieved. Further enhancement of
the merit function would require increasing the total optical
thickness of the design (refer to <a class="reference external" href="idh_gradual_evolution.html">Gradual
Evolution</a>).</p>
<p>You can track the progress of the optimization procedure in the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization_dialog.html">Needle Variation window</a>
and in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_refinement_window.html">Refinement window</a> (when
Silent mode is disabled).</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/needle_deep_search_icon.png" /> Needle Optimization Deep Search</p>
<p>The Deep Search variant of Needle Optimization should be used in
situations where you are interested in a design with good
performance but have a strict limitation on the number of layers.
During each major iteration, the Deep Search version attempts all
possible needle insertions and subsequent refinements one by one.
The achieved reductions in the merit function are analyzed, and
the insertion variant that provides the largest decrease in the
merit function is selected.
The Deep Search variant is time-consuming and is recommended only
for specific problems. Its advantages become evident in rather
complex problems (involving more than 50 layers, intricate targets
with phase, GD, GDD, etc., requirements).</p>
