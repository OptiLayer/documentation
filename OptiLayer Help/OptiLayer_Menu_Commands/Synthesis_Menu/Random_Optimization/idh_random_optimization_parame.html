<p>This dialog appears when OptiLayer is requested to run <a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization.html">Random
Optimization</a>.</p>
<p>There are two modes of <em>Random Optimization</em>. The first mode is
called Simple:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../../_images/rand_par.png" /></p>
<p>Simple mode corresponds to the first tab of the Random
Optimization Parameters dialog. Enter the number of layers you
wish to have in a random starting design, select at least 2
materials that should be used in it, and the average value of
thicknesses of layers for each of the selected materials.
Additionally, it is necessary to select a material that will be
placed next to the substrate in random starting designs. Please
note that this material should also be selected in the
spreadsheet.
It is also possible to specify minimum and maximum limits for
layer thicknesses, as this can significantly improve the quality
of solutions and computational performance. In Simple mode, random
starting designs are generated inside a specified constrained
domain, and subsequent local optimization procedures are also
performed while taking into account the specified limits for layer
thicknesses.
The “Clear Collection” selection allows clearing the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_collection.html">Collection</a> automatically when
restarting the Random Optimization procedure.
The Design mode of Random Optimization can be selected with the
second tab of the Random Optimization Parameters dialog.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../../_images/rand_par2.png" /></p>
<p>In the Design mode search area of the Random Optimization is
specified as some vicinity of the loaded design. It is possible to
specify RMS or Relative RMS for each layer thickness. It is also
possible to select the type of the random generator that will be
used for obtaining layer thickness deviation of the starting
designs in the course of the Random Optimization procedure. The
type of random values can be Uniform, Normal, or Fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>In the case of Uniform distribution, RMS columns specify an
absolute or relative interval for the uniform random numbers.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>In the case of Normal distribution, RMS columns specify
absolute or relative RMS values for the Normal distribution.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>In the case of Fixed selection, the value of the layer
thickness remains unchanged.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Additionally, it is possible to set constraints for each layer
thickness, which usually significantly improves computational
performance and the quality of obtained solutions. In the Design
mode, random starting designs are generated around the design
loaded into RAM with default 15% relative root mean square
deviations of layer thicknesses from loaded values. Specified
layer thickness limits are taken into account both when starting
designs are specified and when local optimization procedures are
performed.</div>

<p>Note 1: Layers with Fixed status are fixed at the beginning of the
refinement and released for optimization in the next step. This
improvement allows for a more concentrated search around the selected
design, as the thicknesses of fixed layers do not change significantly
during the Random Optimization procedure.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../../_images/arrow_r.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note 2: RMS value specifies how big the deviations could be from the
current design thickness. With a higher value, you extend the size of
the search area and increase the chances of finding another good
minimum. However, if the size is too big, the number of attempts
required to find something good increases dramatically. There exists a
golden middle RMS value specific to each problem that needs to be
experimented with. If the initial minimum is obtained too often,
increase the RMS values. If it is obtained very rarely or never, then
the RMS values are already too big.</p>
<p>The Starting TOT option allows you to select a starting value of the
total optical thicknesses (TOT) for random designs to better concentrate
random optimization around expected or desired values. When Any is
selected, this option is not active. Selection of Design will set the
TOT of generated random designs to be equal to the TOT of the current
design. Selection of Value allows you to enter the desired starting TOT
value explicitly in numerical form.</p>
<p>Simply -&gt; Constraints button in Simple mode allows you to set initial
settings for the Design mode according to the settings on the Simple
tab. This is a convenient operation since Simple mode is usually used at
the very first step of the design procedure.</p>
<p>The Limits… button opens an additional <a class="reference external" href="limits_generator.html">Limits
Generator</a> dialog to invoke the recalculation
of upper and lower constraints for layer thicknesses (Th.Min and Th.Max
columns).</p>
<p>Press OK to start Random Optimization. The progress of the optimization
is displayed in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_refinement.html">Refinement window</a>.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../../_images/arrow_r.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note: The random optimization procedure will run infinitely if the Time
Limit is not set and should be terminated by the user when enough
promising designs are collected in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_collection.html">Collection
window</a>.</p>
