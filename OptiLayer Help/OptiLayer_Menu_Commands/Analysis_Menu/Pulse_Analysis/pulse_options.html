<p>Pulse properties can be described with two files: one with
Spectrum data and another with Phase information (it could be
phase, GD, or GDD). In this case, the full path should be entered
into the corresponding entry fields either directly or using
Browse… buttons. Pulse information should be represented as a
two-column text file, where the first column should be wavelength
in nm and the second should be the related characteristic.
In the case of file representation, the Central Wavelength of the
pulse can be computed automatically based on imported data, or it
could be specified directly.
Another way is based on the Super-Gauss intensity shape and phase
information retrieved from the currently loaded Target file. For
this case, you need to activate the second Super-Gauss tab and
select the Create Phase properties from Target data checkbox.
Selection of this phase setting means that we assume the pulse to
be exactly opposite to the target phase, as it is logical to
assume that one tries to obtain full compensation of the phase
modulation.</p>

<p>Half-Width and Order entry fields describe the shape of the
Super-Gauss pulse, while Lam Min and Lam Max are responsible for
the spectral range.</p>
<p>The relative width of the time window is responsible for the fast
Fourier transform settings used to compute the time-domain pulse
representation. It is controlled as a power of 2, and the default
recommended value is 0 (auto-computed value is used without
further modification). If you increase this value, the size of the
window increases, minimizing numerical artifacts, but
computational time also increases quickly. Be careful when
increasing this value, as it is easy to encounter long computation
times and problems with memory size in the 32-bit version.</p>
<p>Delay allows for additional shifting of the output pulse on the
time axis. In some cases, it is convenient, especially if the
obtained delay is rather significant, and it is necessary to
compare the shapes of the pulse with the Fourier-limited version.</p>
<p>Type selection should be configured in accordance with the data
provided as a source of phase information.</p>
<p>Compute describes what pulse you will see on the output. It could
be just the input pulse with the applied phase modulation; in this
case, you can compare it with the Fourier-limited version and
estimate the required level of compression. Alternatively, you can
select reflected or transmitted versions for any polarization of
light.</p>
<p>The incident angle is used during the computation of the output
pulse.</p>

<p>If Override Angle options are used in Multi-Coating Manager, this value
is ignored, and the values configured in the <a class="reference external" href="multi_coating_manager.html">Multi-Coating
Manager</a> are used instead.</p>
<p>Multiplicity increases the number of reflections; it is useful for
estimating the overall performance of dispersive mirror compressors.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Phase according to Multiplicity should usually be
activated if a Multiplicity higher than 1 is used, especially if pulse
phase information was generated from the target data. The reason for
this adjustment is that in most cases target requirements are formulated
for one reflection (or for one effective reflection in double-angle and
complementary mirror approaches). During this adjustment, the phase is
simply multiplied by the Multiplicity value.</p>
