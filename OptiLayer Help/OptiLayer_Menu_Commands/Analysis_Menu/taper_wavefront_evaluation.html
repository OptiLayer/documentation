<p>When a multilayer coating is applied to a substrate with
noticeable curvature, such as lenses, or if there is significant
non-uniformity within the deposition chamber, the intended
spectral characteristics of the coating might be compromised. This
leads to deviations in both reflectance and transmittance from
their theoretical predictions, as well as inducing wavefront
distortions.
For instance, consider plotting the wavefront distortions
(relative to the wavelength) for a high reflector used in <a class="reference external" href="example3.html">Example
LEC03D3</a>, at the wavelength of 500 nm. Assume
parabolic thickness non-uniformity from the center to the edge of
the substrate, with corresponding taper coefficients of 0.95 and
0.99 for high- and low-index materials, respectively. This visual
representation would illustrate the impact of non-uniform
deposition on the optical performance of the coated lens.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/evtaperwavefront.png" /></p>
<p>The wavelength can be adjusted either through a slider or by
directly entering values in the current entry field. It is also
possible to specify the angle of incidence, polarization, and the
step increment for the wavelength control slider.
Thickness non-uniformity is modeled using taper factors, as
detailed under the <a class="reference external" href="taper_function.html">Taper Function</a>
topic. The method by which these taper coefficients are
incorporated during the evaluation is managed through the
“Parameters…” dialog, which can be accessed and adjusted as
needed.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/taperwavepars1.png" /></p>
<p>If only one environment is defined for the current problem, the
Taper/Wavefront parameters dialog allows you to specify the Taper
coefficients for each layer material at extreme positions (such as
the edges of the lens surface).
To Plot combobox includes the following characteristics:</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/taperwavepars2.png" /></p>
<p>The taper coefficient values for intermediate positions are
computed according to the Taper Interpolation selection: Parabolic
or Linear, and the coefficients at the initial position (for
example, the centers of the lenses) are equal to 1.0.
The selected characteristic is plotted (x-axis) as a function of
the Relative Coordinate (i.e., from the lens center to the lens
edge) or the Wavelength.
If the Wavelength is selected as the x-axis variable in the
Taper/Wavefront parameters dialog, the evaluation window looks
different:</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/taperwavepars3.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, the slider or the Current entry field controls the
Relative Coordinate.
If <a class="reference external" href="taper_function.html">Taper Coefficients</a> are specified with
the <a class="reference external" href="envmanfrm.html">Environments Manager</a>, they can be used
in the Taper/Wavefront Evaluation. In this case, the
Taper/Wavefront parameters dialog has an additional tab:
Environments.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/taperwavepars4.png" /></p>
<p>In this scenario, where four distinct environments are configured,
it is necessary to specify the Relative Position for each
environment. This positioning uses a coordinate system that
extends from the center to the edge of the lens. The taper
coefficients for each position are obtained from the
configurations of the environments, and linear interpolation is
used for intermediate positions.
It should be noted that parabolic settings are not available when
specifying environments. The rest of the dialog is similar to the
Simple case described above.</p>
