<p>The evaluation of standing wave electric fields inside a stack of
films is carried out using the Field command from the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_analysis.html">Analysis
Menu</a>. This command computes the
electric field intensity within the current design and displays it
graphically as shown below. The physical thickness profile of the
layers in the design is represented by the design bar, which is
displayed just below the graph of electric field strength. The
design bar displays different layer materials in various colors
and/or patterns. Additionally, the number of layers, N, and the
overall thickness, Th, of the coating design are also shown.
|E|² values are expressed in relative units when the incident
wave has |E|² = 100%. Since these values are quadratic, |E|² can
reach 400% in the incident medium in the case of high reflectors.</p>

<p>You can choose the wavelength at which you want to observe the
electric field distribution by using the mouse to move the slider
in the Wavelength frame. The overall spectral range applicable to
the slider is displayed in the Min and Max fields and can be
altered; the slider’s current position is shown in the Current
field as the wavelength value.
If you check the Snap box on the right side of the window, you can
restrict the slider to a specific range of wavelength values. When
the Snap box is engaged, the slider will only stop at positions
dictated by the minimum and maximum wavelength values and the
increment specified in the Step field. It’s important to note that
the increment is always measured in nanometers and must fall
within a range of 1 to 100.
Additionally, you can specify the Angle of incidence and the
Polarization state (S, P, or Both) in the designated input fields.</p>

<p>Many useful commands are accessible through the right-click popup menu.
For example, “Show Substrate” and “Show Incident Medium” activate the
display of electric field intensity in the corresponding areas. It is
also possible to specify the range of layers of interest when the
substrate and incident medium are not displayed. Use the “Start Layer”
and “End Layer” controls in this menu when “Show Substrate” and “Show
Incident Medium” are not selected.
Angular and Spectral Modes can also be switched using this menu. In
Angular mode, the Field window will allow you to study the angular
dependence of the electric field distribution.</p>
