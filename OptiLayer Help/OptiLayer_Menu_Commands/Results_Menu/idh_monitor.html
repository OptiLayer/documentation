<p>Creating a good set of instructions for an optical monitoring
system can be a tedious task. The OptiLayer Monitor option,
accessible from the / <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_results.html">Results menu</a>,
enables the user to create a monitoring spreadsheet for the design
currently loaded in memory. The OptiMonitor dialog window allows
the user to specify the parameters required for this purpose.
The OptiMonitor window is divided into three sections. The
proportions of the three sections in the monitor window can be
adjusted by placing the mouse on the dividing bar between the
sections. When this is done, a set of short parallel lines with
outward-pointing arrows appears. Clicking with the left mouse
button and dragging the divider bar will allow you to adjust the
proportions of the OptiMonitor window. The Monitoring Spreadsheet
occupies the left upper part of the window. The Witness
Spreadsheet occupies the right upper part of the window; it is
used to specify information about the witness chips. The Graphic
Display occupies the lower part of the window; it displays a
graphical representation of the reflection from (or transmission
through) the witness chip as the layers of the coating are being
deposited. The graph emulates the theoretical response of the
optical monitor system during the deposition process.</p>

<p class="p-heading2 rubric" id="the-monitoring-spreadsheet">The Monitoring Spreadsheet</p>
<p>The Monitoring Spreadsheet consists of 15 columns (some columns
are hidden by default; use the top-left grid corner to activate a
pull-down menu controlling the visibility of individual columns).</p>
<ul>

<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>The first two columns show layer material abbreviations
(Abbr) and layer physical thicknesses (Th.) for the design

<p>The 3rd column (C) indicates the number of the witness chip
on which the corresponding design layers will be deposited.</p>

<p>The 4th column (L) displays the number of design layers to be

correspondence between the design layers and witness chips is
set in the Witness Spreadsheet located in the right upper
part of the window (see below).</p>

<p>In the 5th column, the user can specify correction factors
(Corr) representing the ratios between the physical
thicknesses of layers on a witness chip and the actual
physical thicknesses of the material being deposited on the
actual parts being coated. Note that default correction
factors are equal to 1.</p>

<p>The 6th column (λ) is used to specify the wavelength at which
the optical monitoring is being done for each specific layer.

Adjustment</a> option invoked by
clicking the button λ in the left upper corner of the window.</p>

<p>The 14th column (Swing, %) displays the signal swing value
determined as the ratio of the difference between the
trigger-point signal value and the maximum of the signal to
the signal amplitude. Signal amplitude is the difference
between the signal maximum and minimum values. If a maximum
or minimum of the signal, or both, are not available during
layer deposition, OptiLayer considers a sufficient virtual
increase in the layer thickness until the required extrema
are located.</p>

<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>The 15th column (Response) shows more detailed information on
the spectral response during the layer deposition. The first
and last values in this column correspond to the
transmittance/reflectance of the witness chip at the
beginning and end of the layer deposition, respectively.
Between these values, all spectral response maxima and minima
that occur during the layer deposition are shown. Spectral
response maxima are shown in red while spectral response
minima are shown in green. For additional details on the
spectral response, refer to the plots below.</p>

<p>Note: It is possible to control the visibility of columns using the
button at the top-left corner of the spreadsheet. The visibility of the
columns is preserved between OptiLayer sessions. See also / <a class="reference external" href="fixing_wavelength_of_some_laye.html">Fixing
Wavelength of Some Layers</a>.</p>
<p>General settings related to the physical configuration of the monitor
system are made in the upper-left corner of the monitoring spreadsheet.
The user can choose the Mode of the spectral response (T for
transmittance or R for reflectance). The polarization of the light on
the witness chip (monitor glass) is specified in the Pol field, and the
angle of incidence at which the light from the monitor source hits the
witness chip is set in the Angle field. In the case where the monitoring
is done in reflectance, the user should uncheck the Back Side box if the
reflectance from the Back Side of the witness chip is suppressed.</p>
<section id="graphical-representation">
<h2>Graphical representation</h2>
<p>The theoretical spectral response of the monitor system is plotted in
the bottom portion of the OptiMonitor window. With the help of the
Display control, the user can choose whether to show the plot for one
layer only (Current) or for all the layers at once (All). To easily
distinguish between the layers, the responses for different layers are
colored alternately. The Axis control allows you to select an
appropriate scale for the response plot. The numerical values of the
plotted response characteristic can be found in the monitoring
spreadsheet in the upper part of the window (columns Ratio and
Response).</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/monitoptionsgr.png" /></p>
<p>This control can be opened by hovering the mouse over the Options field
to the left of the graphical representation of the monitoring signals.
The Bad Monitoring control allows one to visualize layers having a
monitoring signal with bad quality for reliable monitoring purposes. It
can also be opened by hovering the mouse over the left side of the plots
window.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/badmonitoring.png" /></p>
<p>Selecting different conditions, corresponding levels, and the
visualization color, it is easy to visualize layers with bad monitoring
conditions, as shown in the illustration below.</p>

<section id="the-witness-spreadsheet-setting-up-the-witness-chip-parameters">
<h2>The Witness spreadsheet - setting up the witness chip parameters</h2>
<p>The choice of which type of material to use for a witness chip, how many
chips to use to monitor the deposition of a design, and how many layers
should be deposited on each chip is essential for the development of a
successful monitoring scheme. These parameters are selected in the
Witness spreadsheet in the upper right corner of the Monitoring window.
Please note that two different strategies of chip management are
supported. If Permit Reusing of Chips is selected (see / <a class="reference external" href="miscellaneousmonitoringoptio.html">Miscellaneous
Monitoring Options</a>), then
repetitive use of chips is allowed, and the appearance of the monitoring
spreadsheet is adjusted accordingly.
The chip material can be chosen from any of the substrate materials in
the current Problem directory. The available materials can be reviewed
by clicking the small arrow to the right of the Def Chip field in the
upper right-hand corner of the OptiMonitor window. This will open a
small popup window. Use the scroll bar to review all the material
choices and double-click on the material you will use for the monitor
chip.
The first column in the Witness spreadsheet displays the witness chip
number, with chip #1 being the chip that the first layer is deposited
on.
The second column in the Witness spreadsheet, labeled L, displays the
number of layers to be deposited on the corresponding witness chip. The
program always assumes by default that all layers in a design will be
deposited on one witness chip. This is indicated by the fact that
initially chip #1 has a number in column L that is the same as the total
number of layers in the design. In most cases, the default choice will
not be correct. Enter the number of layers you want to deposit on chip
#1 in column L and press the Enter key. A second chip will automatically
be created with the remaining layers of the design assigned to it. Enter
the number of layers to be deposited on the second chip in column L and
repeat the process described above until all the layers in the design
have been assigned to a witness chip.
The third column of the Witness spreadsheet is labeled with the letter
T, signifying the thickness of the witness chip. You can also
appropriately modify the thicknesses of each chip. The thickness of the
witness chip is important if the material displays any significant
absorption.</p>
