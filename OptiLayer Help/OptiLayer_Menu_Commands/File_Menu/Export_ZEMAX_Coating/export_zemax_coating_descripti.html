<p>When exporting the ZEMAX coating description from OptiLayer, users
have the flexibility to choose from four different ways of
representing layer thicknesses: absolute thicknesses or relative
thicknesses, each with the option of including or excluding a
zero-thickness Substrate layer in the coating stack.
Here is a breakdown of the thickness representation options
available:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Absolute Thicknesses: This option allows users to export the
thicknesses of the coating layers in physical units,
providing a direct representation of the actual physical
thicknesses used in the design.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Relative Thicknesses: With this option, users can export the
optical thicknesses of the coating layers, which are
normalized by the wavelength of light propagating through the
layers. This representation is particularly useful for
analyzing coatings in terms of their optical properties.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the inclusion of a substrate layer:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>ZEMAX requires the inclusion of a substrate layer in the
coating specification if the substrate is opaque. The
selection of the corresponding export type ensures that the
substrate layer is included accurately.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>If the “With Substrate” option is chosen, OptiLayer
automatically adds a zero-thickness layer with the refractive
index corresponding to the substrate as the first layer in
the coating stack. This aligns with the layer numbering
convention in OptiLayer, where the substrate is considered
the first layer.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Even if the substrate is transparent and the zero-thickness
substrate layer is included by mistake, it does not impact
the performance of the multilayer coating in ZEMAX, as the
layer has zero thickness and represents the optical
properties of the substrate.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing these options for representing layer thicknesses and
seamlessly including or excluding the substrate layer in the
export process, OptiLayer ensures accurate and flexible data
transfer to ZEMAX software for comprehensive optical system design
and analysis.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p>After selecting one of the thickness export options, the following
dialog box will be displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../../_images/zemax_export_coat.png" /></p>
<p>In this dialog, there is an option to specify a different Coating
Name that will be assigned to the coating in the ZEMAX Coating
file. This name must adhere to ZEMAX naming conventions, meaning
that no spaces or special characters are permitted.
At the bottom part of the dialog, a list of materials already
existing in the ZEMAX file is provided for user convenience.
In the middle section of the dialog, a material names substitution
table is presented. OptiLayer suggests a name for each material
used in the design that complies with ZEMAX naming conventions.
Users have the option to manually change the name by typing in an
alternative. Any material names that match those of already
defined materials are highlighted in cells with a red background.
The “Conv” column in the table indicates the required conversion
state for each material:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>A blank cell indicates that no conversion is necessary, and
the material can be directly stored in ZEMAX format.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>An asterisk (*) denotes that conversion to tabular form is
required. For instance, this may be needed when the material
is presented as a formula or composition. The conversion to
tabular format can be done using the parameters specified at
the bottom of the dialog, such as Min Wavelength, Max
Wavelength, and Number of Points.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the export operation encounters material names that are
identical to those already present in the ZEMAX Coating file, an
error message will be displayed, and the export process will fail.
To prevent this issue, users can select the “Overwrite Materials
in ZEMAX Coating File” option.</p>
<p>This robust process ensures that material names align with ZEMAX
conventions and that any necessary conversions are performed
accurately during the export operation, enabling a smooth transfer
of coating information between OptiLayer and ZEMAX.</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<table class="docutils align-default">
<tbody>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><img alt="image7" src="../../../_images/arrow_r.png" /></p></td>
<td><p>When considering overwriting already defined materials,
it is crucial to exercise extreme caution as this action
may impact the performance of other coatings that also
utilize these materials.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>In the provided example, the materials have the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>TiO2_A: Exported with the name TIO2A, conversion is necessary</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Suprasil: This material will be exported as SUPRASIL with no
conversion required.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>SiO2: Exported as SIO2 with conversion required.
Additionally, a material with the same name is already
defined in the ZEMAX Coating file. If the “Overwrite
Materials in ZEMAX Coating file” option is not selected, a
warning will be displayed during the export operation.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To proceed with the Coating Export procedure, click the “OK”
button. This will initiate the export process, taking into account
the necessary conversions and addressing any warnings related
tomaterial names conflicts. By exercising caution and considering
the implications of overwriting materials, users can ensure the
integrity and optimal performance of coatings utilizing shared
materials in the ZEMAX environment.</p>
