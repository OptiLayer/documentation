<p>In OptiLayer, users have the option to export the current design
description or the spectral performance of the current design to
ZEMAX software for optical system design. ZEMAX, developed by
Zemax Development Corporation, is a widely-used software tool for
optical design and analysis.
ZEMAX stores multilayer coatings and associated information in
files with the .dat extension, with the default file name as
COATING.DAT. It is advised not to modify or alter the COATING.DAT
file according to the ZEMAX manual.
For compatibility and best practices, OptiLayer suggests saving
designs in a file with a similar name, maintaining the convention
used by ZEMAX. This helps ensure seamless communication and
accurate data transfer between OptiLayer and ZEMAX software
applications.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/zemax_exp1.png" /></p>
<p>In OptiLayer, the process of exporting design information to ZEMAX
software for optical system design involves the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Specify ZEMAX File: Users can designate the ZEMAX file
containing the description of multilayer coatings by
entering the path and filename in the edit fields or by
utilizing the Browse button to navigate to the desired file
location.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Load ZEMAX File: Once the file is located, users can click
on the Load button to import the contents of the file into
the Export dialog within OptiLayer. This step enables
OptiLayer to export designs to the specified ZEMAX file.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>ZEMAX File Components: ZEMAX files contain essential
information about layer materials, their dispersive
properties (Material tab), design descriptions (Coating
tab), and optionally, performance properties of multilayers
(Ideal, Ideal2, Table tabs). Users can refer to the ZEMAX
documentation for detailed insights into these components.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Editing Options: Within the Export dialog, users can view
the contents of the ZEMAX Coating file and have the option
to delete materials if needed. This capability is
particularly useful as ZEMAX imposes limitations on the
total number of materials that can be included in the file.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps and leveraging the functionalities
provided in the Export dialog, users can seamlessly export optical
design data from OptiLayer to ZEMAX software, ensuring accuracy
and consistency in the design transfer process.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/zemax_exp_popup.png" /></p>
<p>When the Export Design button is pressed in OptiLayer to transfer
optical design information to ZEMAX software, a popup menu will
appear to allow the user to select the desired export mode. The
menu typically includes four different <a class="reference external" href="export_zemax_coating_descripti.html">export options for the
design specification</a>,as
well as an additional option for <a class="reference external" href="export_zemax_performance_table.html">exporting the data as a
performance table.</a></p>
<p>The available export options are typically listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p><a class="reference external" href="export_zemax_coating_descripti.html">Export ZEMAX Coating
description</a>: This
export option allows users to transfer the detailed
description of the multilayer coatings and design parameters
from OptiLayer to ZEMAX. By selecting this option, users can
seamlessly export the coating specifications, material
properties, dispersive properties, and design characteristics
for further analysis and simulation in ZEMAX software.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p><a class="reference external" href="export_zemax_performance_table.html">Export ZEMAX Performance
Table</a>: In addition to
exporting the coating description, users can choose this
option to export the optical performance data in the form of
a performance table. This option enables the transfer of
spectral performance information, including transmittance,
reflectance, phase and group delay, and other performance
metrics, which can be utilized for optimizing optical system
designs in ZEMAX.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing these distinct export options, OptiLayer empowers
users to tailor the transfer of optical design data to meet their
specific requirements in ZEMAX software. This flexibility enables
seamless integration between the two software tools and
streamlines the design workflow for enhanced efficiency and
accuracy in optical system design and analysis.</p>
