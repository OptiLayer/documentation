<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the Random
optimization … mode, which finds designs through multiple
optimizations with random starting designs.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D11. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the Hot mirror target. This
target specifies requirements for 100% transmittance in the
400-690 nm spectral range and 0% transmittance in the 710-1200 nm
spectral range. The target transmittance can be viewed in the
Preview tab of the Target editor.</p>
<p>In the previous LEC24D10 example, a gradual evolution design
procedure was used to design the required hot mirrors. Elimination
of thin layers in designs has been shown to be challenging. The
design option considered in this example allows the application of
lower and upper constraints on the thicknesses of all coating
layers. It will be shown that constrained optimization with random
starting designs will allow us to obtain designs without thin
layers and better merit function values than that of the design
obtained in the previous example after removing thin layers.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis menu, select the Randon Optimization… option. The
window for setting random optimization parameters will open. This
window has two tabs: Global and Local. The Global tab allows you
to run the option with starting designs generated in entire area
specified by the Min and Max parameters in the window, and the
Local tab sets parameters for selecting starting designs in some
vicinity to a given design.</p>
<p>** **</p>
<p>It is generally recommended to start the design procedure from the
Global tab options. The results of the gradual evolution procedure
in LEC24D10 give us a general idea of the number of layers and
total optical thickness of the design required to achieve the
desired level of approximation of the hot mirror target
transmittance. We will set 40 in The number of layers field and
set the average optical thicknesses of H and L materials to 200
nm. This will ensure that the total optical thicknesses of
starting designs are close to the value of 8000 nm set for
calculations in LEC24D10. The lower and upper limits (Min and Max
fields) on the optical thicknesses of all layers will be 100 nm
and 350 nm, respectively.</p>
<p>Make sure that in the Materials nearest to the substrate field the
abbreviation H for the high index layer is set.</p>
<p>Click the OK button and go to the main window of the Random
Optimization… option. Clicking the Run button starts the design
procedure. The progress of the design procedure is reflected on
the left side of the window, and the MF, N, and TOT parameters of
the final designs obtained using randomly generated starting
designs are shown on the right side of the window. The results
obtained are sorted in accordance with the merit functions values
achieved at each optimization procedure. You can terminate the
design procedure at any time by clicking the Stop button.</p>
<p>You can select any design with the parameters listed on the right
side of the window and use the Load button to move it to the
General Information window and T&amp;R&amp;Phase window. The design can
then be saved in the design database.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may be worth searching for a better design in
the vicinity of the selected design. To do this, click the
Parameters button and switch to the Local tab at the top of the
parameters window. If this tab is active, further optimization
procedures will be performed using the starting designs from the
vicinity of the selected design. This vicinity is determined by
the related parameters set in the RMS or Relative RMS columns.
Click the OK button and then the Run button in the main window to
continue optimization. Often the best results are achieved this
way.</p>
<p>It may be worth running random optimization using different local
optimization methods, since it is impossible to predict which one
will work best for your specific project.</p>
<p>Sample hot mirror designs HM1 and HM2 are saved in the design
database.</p>
