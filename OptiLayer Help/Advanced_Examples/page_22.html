<p>In amorphous states of thin film materials, variations in their
refractive indices depend on variations in the densities of these
states. The latter depend on various parameters of the deposition
process, such as the energy and flux density of the deposited
atoms,  the flux of oxygen atoms, if reactive deposition is used,
the flux of assisting atoms, if there is additional ion
assistance. All these parameters fluctuate and this causes
fluctuations in the film packing density and in the refractive
index of the growing layer. This is called the bulk inhomogeneity
of coating layers. In layers deposited by modern deposition
processes, the bulk inhomogeneity is small and there are only rare
situations where it should be taken into account.  Nevertheless,
it is useful to become familiar with the effects caused by bulk
inhomogeneity, and such an acquaintance is the main purpose of
this example.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D18. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the design QWM-19, c.w. 600 nm.
Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu. Use the Axis
option to display the transmittance of the 19-layer QWM in the
spectral range from 150 nm to 800 nm.</p>
<p>The measure of the bulk inhomogeneity is the degree of
inhomogeneity, the absolute value of which is defined as the
difference in the layer refractive indices at its right and left
boundaries, divided by the mean refractive index of the layer.
Most often, the degree of inhomogeneity is expressed as a
percentage, i.e. as its absolute value multiplied by 100%. Both
negative and positive values of the degree of inhomogeneity in the
range of several percent are possible. Positive values up to 2-3%,
and sometimes higher, are observed in the case of high-energy
deposition processes. Negative values are typical for low-energy
deposition processes.</p>
<p>In the Analysis menu, select the Inhomogeneity option. At the
Characteristic tab of the Inhomogeneity Setup window, select the
transmittance (T) at zero incidence angle (normal incidence) to be
displayed.</p>
<p>Use the Inhomogeneities tab to enter the degrees of inhomogeneity
for the high and low index layers. Let us start with -3% degrees
of inhomogeneity for all mirror layers.</p>
<p>Click OK to start the analysis procedure. The upper part of the
Inhomogeneity Analysis window displays the transmittance of an
ideal mirror without inhomogeneity (black curve) and the
transmittance of a mirror with inhomogeneous layers (red curve).
The difference between the black and red curves is barely
noticeable at all wavelength, except for a small vicinity of 300
nm. The refractive index profiles of the ideal mirror and the
mirror with inhomogeneous layers are shown in the lower part of
the window.</p>
<p>Use the Parameters tab in the lower left corner of the window to
specify other degrees of inhomogeneity (e.g. +3% for high index
layers and 0% for low index layers). Note that you can easily set
different values for odd and even layers using the Apply to: field
in the Column editor window.</p>
<p>Computational experiments with the degrees of inhomogeneity in the
range of a few percent lead to the same conclusion: the effect of
bulk inhomogeneity is noticeable only near 300 nm.</p>
<p> Note that the wavelength of 300 nm is half the mirror central
wavelength. It corresponds to a frequency twice the frequency
corresponding to the mirror central wavelength and is important
for coatings used in some laser systems. Here it may be necessary
to take into account bulk inhomogeneity in coating layers.</p>
