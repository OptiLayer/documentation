<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the Color
analysis and synthesis options of the OptiLayer software.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D15. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Polycarbonate, the layer
materials Nb2O5 and SiO2 from the Rochester Institute of
Technology database, the target file AR at 380-780 nm, 0-45
degree, and the 6-layer AR design. The target file specifies
requirements for zero Rs and Rp reflectances in the spectral range
from 380 to 780 nm and for a set of incidence angles in the
0–45-degree range.</p>
<p>Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu to see the spectral
characteristics of the loaded design. Note that it provides
excellent antireflection properties.</p>
<p>Let us examine the color properties of the loaded design in
reflected light. To do this, open the Color… option in the
Analysis menu. In the Characteristic field of the Color Evaluation
Parameters window select Reflectance as the characteristic to
examine. In the Polarization field select the Average option.</p>
<p>To examine the color properties in a range of incidence angles,
select the Range option and set the minimum and maximum angle
values to 0 and 45. Enter 10 as the number of points in the
specified angular range. In the Display field, leave only Color
Target and Design selected. The Design selection will allow us to
see the colors of the loaded design in reflected light at
different angles. The color target is not loaded yet, but this
selection will be needed later. Leave all other selections as
their defaults. Clicking the Calculate button opens the Color
Evaluation window with the choice of CIE xyz (1931) (see the top
tabs) Color Diagram (see the bottom tabs).  Note that bottom tabs
allow you to switch between Spreadsheet and Color Diagram
presentations of the color analysis results, while the top tabs
are used to select different color spaces. The set of red
triangles on the color diagram shows how the color changes as the
viewing angle changes.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to apply an antireflection coating to eye-glasses
and we do not want the color to change with the viewing angle. We
will formulate this requirement for the angular range of 0-45
degrees. This is done by introducing the color target White color
in reflected light 0-45 degree. In the Data -&gt; Color Target
database, select this file and use the Edit tab to see the color
target specification. You can use the Preview tab of the Color
Target window to view the target on the Color diagram.</p>
<p>Load the color target file into RAM. Note that it is marked on the
color diagram.</p>
<p>Select the Refinement option in the Synthesis menu. The MF value
shown in the first line on the right side of the window
corresponds to the merit function composed of the spectral and
color merit function. Check in Options that the Sequential QP
local optimization method is selected. Click the Run button. In a
few seconds, you will get an optimized design with the MF reduced
by a factor of 3.</p>
<p>Select the top line corresponding to this design and click the
Load button to place it in the General Information and evaluation
windows.</p>
<p>Examine Color Evaluation window. Note that the colors in reflected
light are close to the target color for all requested incidence
angles. Also look at the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window. It is clear that the
requested color properties were achieved at the expense of some
increase in the reflectances in the angular range 0-45 degree. But
this increase is not very large.</p>
<p>The relationship between the requirements for the target color and
spectral properties is controlled by applying weights to the color
and spectral merit functions, which are additive terms of the
composed MF. Giving more wight to one of these functions means
more stringent requirements for the approximation of the
corresponding target. Target weights can be controlled via the
General Information window. To change the weight, click the error
in the desired Target line.</p>
<p>The design obtained taking into account the color requirements is
saved in the design database.</p>
