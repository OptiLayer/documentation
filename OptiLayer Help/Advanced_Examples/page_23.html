<p>The concept of small-scale and large-scale root-mean-square (rms)
roughness was introduced by Tikhonravov et al. in the paper
“Effects of Interface Roughness on the Spectral Properties of Thin
Films and Multilayers” (Applied Optics, 42, 5140-5148, 2003). It
was shown that the effect of roughness on the properties of
optical coatings can be adequately described by these two
parameters. The terms small-scale and large-scale rms roughness
refer to spatial roughness harmonics with periods small or large
compared to the wavelength of the incident light. The theoretical
motivation for introducing two roughness parameters is that they
have different effects on the spectral characteristics of the
coating. The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate this
fact.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D19.  Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate n=1.50, the layer
materials n=1.48 and n=1.64, and the design QWM-63 at 193 nm. The
effects of roughness are more pronounced in the short wavelength
region, especially in the VUV spectral region. For this reason,
the refractive indices of the substrate and layer materials have
values typical of fluoride materials used in this region. The
considered design is a 63-layer quarter-wave mirror with a central
wavelength of 193nm. In the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window use the spectral
range of 160-240 nm to view the transmittance of this design.</p>
<p>In the Analysis menu select the Interface roughness option. The
Interface Roughness Analysis Setup window, use Characteristic tab
to set the analyzed spectral characteristic and mark the type of
roughness to be examined (Small scale or Large scale). Let’s start
with a large scale roughness and select normal incidence
transmittance as the examined characteristic. Note that this type
of roughness results in light loss due to scattering.</p>
<p>The Roughness tab is used to set the rms levels of large scale
roughness at all layer interfaces, starting with the interface of
the first layer with the substrate and ending with the air
boundary of the last mirror layer. We set all these values to 5
nm.</p>
<p>Clicking the OK button opens the Roughness Evaluation window.
Adjust the wavelength range of this window to the range of 160-240
nm. There are two notable effects of the large sale roughness.
This is a narrowing of the high reflection region and a
significant decrease in transmittance outside this region. The
last effect is, of course, due to scattering. Close the Roughness
Evaluation window.</p>
<p>Let us turn our attention to small scale roughness. Select the
Interface roughness option again. In the Characteristic tab of the
Interface Roughness Analysis Setup window, select normal incidence
transmittance and check Small scale roughness. Typically,
small-scale roughness represents the film surface roughness
associated with the deposition process. It is negligible at the
substrate boundary and, in many cases, also negligible at the
other layer boundaries. But there are still deposition processes
and thin film materials that can create small-scale rms roughness
in the range of a few nanometers. This primarily applies to
fluoride films deposited by low energetic processes.</p>
<p>At the Roughness tab, we set the value to zero at the interface of
the first layer with the substrate and set all other values to 5
nm.</p>
<p>Click the OK button and examine the effect of small scale
roughness in the same range of 160-240 nm. The presence of small
scale roughness also leads to a narrowing of the high reflection
zone. But the influence of small-scale and large-scale roughness
outside this zone is very different. This is due to the fact that
small scale roughness does not cause light losses for scattering.
But it causes some redistribution of energy between transmitted
and reflected light beams. Changes in transmittance outside the
high reflection zone are due to this redistribution.</p>
