<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the Thin Layer
Removal option, which allows one to eliminate thin layers of a
design structure at an expense of some increase in the merit
function value.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D10. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the Hot mirror target. This
target specifies requirements for 100% transmittance in the
400-690 nm spectral range and 0% transmittance in the 710-1200 nm
spectral range. The target transmittance can be viewed in the
Preview tab of the Target editor.</p>
<p>Using the General Information window, make sure that there is no
design loaded into RAM. In the Synthesis menu, select the Gradual
evolution design mode. Ensure that a total optical thickness (TOT)
of 8000 nm is specified as the active termination criterion. The
high TOT value was chosen because the target transmittance places
a fairly high requirement for the steepness of the transmittance
in the transition region from 690 to 710 nm.</p>
<p> Make sure that the Newton method is selected as the local
optimization method.</p>
<p>Click the Run button in the lower left corner of the window. The
progress of the gradual evolution design procedure is reflected in
the right, history part of the window. The hot mirror design thus
obtained is stored in the design database as HM by GE with Newton
method. It has 58 layers and pretty good MF value of 0.314.</p>
<p>Load this design and select the Thickness tab in the Refractive
Index Profile window to see the structure of the design. The
design has 20 layers with an optical thickness of less than 50 nm.
Eight layers have a physical thickness of less than 10 nm.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to monitor thin layers, it may be
desirable to eliminate thin layers from the design structure. The
Thin Layer Removal option of the Synthesis menu allows you to do
this at an expense of some increase in the merit function value.
Load the design HM by GE with Newton method and open this option.
The Thickness tab of the Thin Layer Removal window allows you to
visually control the removal of thin layers.</p>
<p>Click the Start button in the lower left corner of the window. A
new window will open in which you can choose between Automatic and
Manual modes of the option (top tabs). Select Manual mode.
Typically, the checkbox Finish with Refinement should be marked.
This means that the design will be re-optimized after each new
thin layer is removed.</p>
<p>It is advisable to start with the thinnest layer. At the bottom
part of the window, select the layer you want to remove and click
the Remove button. The parameters of designs obtained after each
layer removal are shown on the right part of the main window of
the option. You can proceed with removing thin layers by clicking
the Start button again. It is your decision when to stop the
procedure. A couple of designs derived from the original 58-layer
design are stored in the design database. To save any intermediate
design obtained by the procedure, select it on the right part of
the main window and click the Load button to transfer it to the
general information and main evaluation windows.</p>
<p>After this, the design can be saved in the design database using
the Data -&gt; Save data-&gt; Save Design … option.</p>
