<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the operation
of the needle optimization technique and the dependence of its
final results on the total optical thickness of a starting design.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D5. Some datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52 and the
layer materials n=2.35 and n=1.46. First it is necessary to create
a spectral target and single-layer starting design in the
corresponding databases.</p>
<p>** **</p>
<p>In the target database, create a new target with the name RAMP
400-800 nm.  In the Number of spectral points filed, enter 201. A
target spreadsheet with 201 rows will be created.</p>
<p>You can use the convenient editing functions Grid Generator and
Column Editor, which are accessible by right mouse click. In the
Wavelength column, set a uniform grid from 200 to 800 nm with the
2 nm wavelength step.</p>
<p>In the TS column, define a linearly increasing target
transmittance in 0.5 % increments. In the target tolerances (DTS)
column, leave the default values of 1% for all target tolerances.
Use the Preview tab to ensure that the linearly increasing target
transmittance is specified in the range of 400 to 800 nm.</p>
<p>Load the target into RAM. In the design database, create a single
layer starting design with an optical thickness of 1200 nm.</p>
<p>Load this design into RAM and open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window
to see the correspondence between the transmittance of the
starting design and the target transmittance.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis menu, select the Needle Optimization AUTO mode
and click the Run button in the upper left corner of its window.
In a fraction of a second, the final design is obtained. The
achieved merit function value (MF), number of design layers (N),
and total thickness of the design (TT) are shown in the top line
of the window representing the history of the needle optimization
procedure.</p>
<p>Make sure that in the Configuration-&gt; Settings optical thicknesses
are selected as Thickness units for the design representation. To
save the obtained design, click the Load button in the lower right
part of the window. The obtain design is now presented in the
T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window and you can save it in the design
database using Data -&gt; Save Data -&gt; Save Design option.</p>

the design database that was previously obtained using the same
starting design.</p>

options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database.</p>
<p>The achieved match to the target transmittance is already fairly
good, but we can easily obtain a different design with a
transmittance that matches the target transmittance much better.
In the history part of the Needle Auto window, select the initial
single layer design and load it into RAM.</p>
<p>Close the Needle optimization window. Use Synthesis-&gt; Modify
Design option and double the optical thickness of this design to
2400 nm.</p>
<p>Run again the Needle Optimization AUTO procedure with this new
starting design. Again, the final design is obtained in a fraction
of a second. The transmittance of the obtained design matches the
target transmittance much better than before – see the achieved
merit function value (MF) in the top line on the right part of the
window.</p>
<p> Note that a much better fit was obtained at an expense of
increasing the number of design layers (N) and total thickness of
the design (TT).</p>
<p>To save the obtained design, click the Load button to place the
design into RAM, and then use the Data -&gt; Save Data -&gt; Save Design
option to save it in the design database.</p>
<p> Note that there is already the design 23-layer RAMP that was
previously obtained using the same design steps.</p>
<p><strong>Basic conclusion: Total optical thickness of the starting design
plays a key role in the design procedure. By increasing its value,
one can get much better solution to the design problem.</strong></p>
