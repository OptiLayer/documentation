<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer options and
random nature of some of their elements, the results obtained may
differ from those described below.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the
Pre-production Estimation of Errors… mode of the Monitoring menu,
which is used to evaluate the effects associated with error
correlation in the case of optical monitoring of coating
production.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D20. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the hot mirror design HM-2 from
LEC24D11. Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window to view the transmittance of
the loaded design.</p>
<p>Unlike the error analysis options provided in the Analysis menu
and illustrated in LECD24D16 and LEC24D17, the Pre-production
Estimation of Errors option of the Monitoring menu is aimed to
evaluate the effects associated with correlated thickness errors
that are typical for production with optical monitoring. There is
a wide variety of optical monitoring techniques and strategies for
their application. The discussed option is aimed at assessing the
effects associated with direct optical monitoring when
measurements are carried out on one of the produced samples. It is
useful for assessing the cumulative effect of increasing thickness
errors with increasing number of deposited layers. The option can
be used for both monochromatic and broadband optical monitoring.</p>
<p>Let us start with broadband optical monitoring (Monitoring -&gt;
Pre-production Estimation of Errors -&gt; Broadband Monitoring…). In
the window that opens, select normal incidence transmittance as
the monitoring signal. Set the broadband measurement range to
400-900 nm with 501 uniformly distributed spectral points. In the
Errors field check Random Spectral, which means that independent
normally distributed random errors with zero mean values will be
added to the simulated transmittance measurement data. In the
corresponding input field, set the level of these errors to 1%.
This means that the standard deviations of the simulated
transmittance errors will be 1% of the simulated T values.</p>
<p>Click the OK button to run the option. The Pre-production
Estimation of Errors in the window will show the expected levels
of errors in the layer thicknesses caused by random errors
measured transmittance data. The levels of errors are not very
large, but the cumulative effect of increasing errors is clearly
visible.</p>
<p>Now suppose that 0.5 nm random errors are introduced during a
deposition of each new mirror layer. Such errors may be due to
inaccuracies in the deposition process. Since errors in early
layers affect the measured transmittance for subsequent layers,
this will cause additional errors in all layers starting with the
second layer (an effect called correlation of errors in layer
thicknesses). To estimate the errors of a new type, it is possible
to use the Parameters button in the lower left corner of the
Pre-production Estimation of Errors window. In the parameter’s
settings window, switch to Direct Thickness Errors and set the
levels of these errors to 0.5 nm.</p>
<p>Click OK to run the option. Again, the cumulative effect of
increasing errors is clearly visible in the Pre-production
Estimation of Errors window. In all layers, starting with the
second layer, the error levels are higher than the 0.5 nm level of
errors made directly in these layers. This is a negative
consequence of the correlation of thickness errors by the optical
monitoring procedure. It is worth noting that the error pattern
for the last part of the mirror layers resembles that observed in
the previous experiment with random measurement errors. This is
due to the fact that the additional errors caused by the
cumulative effect prevail over the errors of individual layers,
which means that the cumulative effect works in a similar way for
errors related to the deposition process and errors related to
optical monitoring.</p>
<p>Similar experiments can be performed with monochromatic optical
monitoring. They are applicable for the case of direct level
monitoring when the transmittance levels for terminating layer
depositions are not adjusted during the layer depositions. A setup
window similar to the one described above opens when selecting
Monitoring -&gt; Pre-production Estimation of Errors -&gt; Monochromatic
Monitoring… option. In the Monitoring Wavelength field, set the
monitoring wavelength. Let us set the wavelength of 400 nm. When
setting the error levels in the Errors field, it should be taken
into account that monochromatic monitoring is much more sensitive
to random measurement errors than broadband monitoring. Therefore,
we will experiment with a level of such errors of 0.05%. Note that
this value is 20 times smaller than the random error level used in
the experiments with broadband monitoring.</p>
<p>Experiment with different monitoring wavelengths. You can change
the monitoring wavelength using the Parameters tab at the lower
left corner of the window.
 Note that despite the much lower level of measurement errors, the
estimated thickness errors are much higher than in the case of
broadband monitoring.
 Note that the estimated thickness errors are very dependent of
the choice of monitoring wavelength.</p>
