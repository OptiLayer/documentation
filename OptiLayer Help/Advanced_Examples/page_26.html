<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer options and
random nature of some of their elements, the results obtained may
differ from those described below.</p>
<p>This example presents an analysis of the spectral and color
properties of optical coatings used to reduce heat transfer in
double and triple glazing. We use materials typical for such
coatings, with refractive index wavelength dependencies taken from
the open access database Refractive Index Info. In particular, the
refractive index NiCr is modeled based on the Ni and Cr data,
assuming 80% - 20% nickel and chromium content.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D22. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Soda lime glass, the layer
materials Si3N4, Ag, and NiCr, the design Double silver low-E, and
the target AR 420-680 nm + low-E 900-1800 nm. Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase
window to see the spectral target and normal incidence
transmittance of the loaded design. The loaded design is a 9-layer
coating with layer thicknesses set in the ranges specified in the
above-mentioned patent.</p>
<p>The loaded materials have abbreviations H, A, and N for the Si3N4,
Ag, and NiCr, respectively.</p>
<p> Note: that the design has two Ag layers of 11 and 15 nm thickness
and four very thin NiCr layers with the thicknesses of 0.7 nm
each. These NiCr layers are used to improve adhesion at the
boundaries of the Ag and nearby Si3N4 layers.</p>
<p> Note that due to the presence of two silver layers, the 9-layer
design under consideration has a low transmittance in the IR
region, and, accordingly, a low thermal emissivity. In the most
part of the specified AR region, it has a transmittance of over
70%.</p>
<p>To analyze the color properties of this design, go to the Analysis
-&gt; Color… option and in the Color Evaluation Parameters window,
check Transmittance and Reflectance in the Characteristic field.</p>
<p>Click the Calculate button at the bottom of this window. The Color
Evaluation window will open with the CIE xyz (1931) chromaticity
diagram. It shows that the color of the transmitted light is close
to white, and the color of the reflected light is in the blue
color range.</p>
<p>It is worth doing a couple of experiments with the 9-layer design.
First, we will try to improve the transmittance in the AR region
while keeping the NiCr layer thicknesses at 0.7 nm. Use the Edit
command in the design database to see the design spreadsheet of
the Double silver low-E design.</p>
<p>Note that in the Status column of the spreadsheet, all NiCr layers
have the status F, which means that their thicknesses will be kept
unchanged during the refinement procedure.</p>
<p>Go to the Synthesis -&gt; Refinement option and click the Run button
to start the refinement procedure. The transmittance in the AR
region has increased slightly, but this increase is hardly
significant.</p>
<p>Now let us load the Double silver low-E design again. Go to the
Modify Design option and change the status of all NiCr layer to A
(active).</p>
<p>Open the Refinement option again and run the refinement procedure.
A significant improvement in transmittance in the AR region is
observed. Note that this improvement was achieved by removing all
NiCr layers from the design structure. The resulting design has
only 5 layers. It is saved in the design database under the name
Double silver low-E refined NiCr not fixed.</p>
<p>It is worth loading this design and checking its color properties.
They are close to the color properties of the original 9-layer
design.</p>
