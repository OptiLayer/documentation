<h1>Example 1. Main concepts of OptiLayer software. Demonstration using quarter-wave mirrors (QWM)</h1>

<p>One of the main concepts of OptiLayer software is the concept of
decentralized data storage. This means that data related to
different projects of the user is not stored in one directory, but
in separate directories, each of which is intended to solve
specific problems. The corresponding project directories have sets
of databases for storing data related to this project: substrate
and layer refractive indices, target spectral characteristics,
designs, etc. All such databases are stored on the computer’s hard
disk, and to begin working on a project, the user must load the
necessary datafiles from the databases into the computer’s RAM.
The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate how it works.
Another important concept relates to the way how designs of
optical coatings are specified. In OptiLayer, optical thickness
and not physical thickness play a primary role in design
specification. Of course, both types of thicknesses are
interrelated and this example will show how this relation is
established. But any design can be initially specified using a
formula representation. For example, the formula (HL)^9 H
describes a quarter wave mirror having 19 layers with odd high
index layers and even low index layers. The considered example
shows how the physical thicknesses of this mirror are specified in
calculations.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, find the directory
LEC24D1 and open it. The datafiles needed to evaluate the spectral
properties of the 19-layer QWM are already stored on the hard
disk. In Data -&gt;Substrate, look at the contents of the substrate
database. It has an item with the name Glass n=1.52.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/Ex1_1.png" /></p>
<p>Using the Edit tab, check the refractive index of this file.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/Ex1_2.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Note that there is nothing in the wavelength field because the non-dispersive substrate index is specified.</p>
<p>In the same way check the contents of the layer material database.</p>
<p>Go to the design database and check the file QWM-19, c.w. 600 nm.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/Ex1_3.png" /></p>
<p>The number of layers of this design is 19 – see the The number of layers filed. The spreadsheet below has exactly 19 rows corresponding to the layers of this design and numbered according
to the layer number, starting from the substrate. The Material
column of this spreadsheet has the default designations for the refractive indices of design layers with abbreviations H and L. These abbreviations are specified in the Odd material and Even
material fields at the upper part of the spreadsheet. Note that
the specific layer materials will be set later. The Physical th
column has zeros in all rows because these thicknesses are not yet
specified. The column QWOT (quarter wave optical thicknesses) has
the default values of 1. In fact, the values in the QWOT column
and the letters in the Material column correspond to the formula
(HL)^9 H for a 19-layer quarter wave mirror. The value 600 in the
Control wavelength field at the upper part of the window specifies
the control wavelength of the QWM in nanometers. In accordance
with this wavelength, the values of the layer optical thicknesses
in the Optical th column are determined. The FWOT column specifies
the layer optical thicknesses as full wave optical thicknesses
that are four times the quarter wave optical thicknesses.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/Ex1_4.png" /></p>
<p>To evaluate spectral characteristics of a 19-layer QWM, load the
substrate datafile, layer material datafiles, and design into RAM
(Load tabs in the respective databases). Check the General
information window (first option in the View menu).</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/Ex1_5.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../_images/Ex1_6.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Note that the names of the downloaded datafiles have arrived in
the corresponding lines of the General information window. Also note that the abbreviations H and L have been automatically assigned to the low and high indices of the downloaded materials.</p>
<p>In the design database, open the file QWM-19, c.w. 600 nm.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/Ex1_7.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Note that the Physical th column now has non-zeros values in all
rows. The layer physical thicknesses were determined from the
corresponding optical thickness values using the refractive
indices of the loaded materials.</p>
<p>It is now possible to evaluate the spectral characteristics of the
quarter wave mirror. To do this, go to the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the
Analysis menu. The mirror transmittance is plotted in the default
spectral range of 400 to 800 nm.</p>
<p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/Ex1_8.png" /></p>
<p>It is possible to change the evaluation spectral range and the
characteristics plotted. To do this, use the right mouse click in
the evaluation window. To add additional characteristics for
plotting, use the Add button in the Plot options window.</p>
