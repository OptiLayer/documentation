<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate loading of
substrate and layer material refractive indices from OptiLayer
Catalogs and to show how the back side of the substrate is
accounted for.  In parallel, it is shown how dispersive refractive
indices are specified in the corresponding database.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D3. There are only two datafiles in the Design database:
2-layer AR for 600 nm- 1 and …- 2. View these designs in the Edit
tab.</p>
<p> Note that there no values in the Physical th column. This is
because there is no layer material loaded into RAM, meaning both
designs currently only exist in formula form.</p>
<p>In this example, we will use the substrate and layer material
datafiles from the Catalog available in the File menu.</p>
<p>In the Substrate section of the catalog, select B 270 glass as the
substrate and click the Transfer tab to place it in the design
database of the directory LEC24D3.</p>
<p>Transfer the layer material datafiles Ta2O5 (190-800nm, RIT) and
SiO2 (150-800nm, RIT) in the same way. Make sure these datafiles
are included in the corresponding databases. In the Edit -&gt; Table
tabs, the wavelength dependencies of the refractive indices and
extinction coefficients are presented in tabular form. The entered
wavelength dependencies can be seen in the Preview tabs.</p>
<p>Load the substrate and layer material datafiles into RAM. In the
Edit tab of the design database, verify that the physical
thicknesses of the design layers are now available in the first
column of the design spreadsheet. Load the first design into RAM
and open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu.</p>
<p>By right-click in the evaluation window, select the Plot -&gt; Plots
options and set the normal incidence reflectance to be plotted.
Using the Axis settings, select a wavelength range of 550-650 nm
and a y-axis scale of 0 to 1 %.</p>
<p> Note that the design 2-layer AR for 600 nm- 1 reduces the
reflectance from the substrate-air interface to less than 0.1% in
the 40 nm wide spectral region around 600 nm. Such 2-layer
antireflection designs can be used as top layers to increase the
transmittance of narrow band pass filters in their passband
regions.</p>
<p>Load the second design 2-layer AR for 600 nm- 2. It also offers
zero reflectance at 600 nm, but its “less than 0.1%” spectral rage
is somewhat narrower than before.</p>
<p> Note that so far we have considered the normal incidence
reflectance from the substrate-air interface without taking into
account the reflection from the back side of the substrate.</p>
<p>To accomodate the back side of the substrate, mark Yes in the Back
side line of the General Information window.</p>
<p>To see the reflectance curve in the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window, change the
y-axis scale to 0-10%. The reflectance is increased to more than
4% in the considered spectral region.</p>
<p> Note that it is possible to reduce the reflectance by applying an
antireflection coating to the back side of the substrate.</p>
<p>To do this, add any of the AR designs to the Back Design line of
the General Information window.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Additional example –
admittance diagrams</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Check No in the Back side line of the General Information window
and open the Admittance… option in the Analysis menu.</p>
<p>At the wavelength of 600 nm, the admittance diagram begins at the
refractive index of the substrate and ends at exactly 1, that is,
at the refractive index of incident medium (Air). According to
theory, this provides zero reflectance at this wavelength.</p>
