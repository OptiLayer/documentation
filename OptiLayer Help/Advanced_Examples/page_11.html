<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database.
The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the operation
of the gradual evolution design technique without the use of
starting design.
In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D7. Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already loaded
into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the Notch filter target. This
target can be viewed in the Preview tab of the Target editor.</p>
<p>The gradual evolution design procedure can be started without any
starting design. In fact, this means that it uses a fictious layer
with zero thickness as a starting design and then increases its
thickness to a certain non-zero value. This procedure is based on
combining a series of needle optimization procedures with a
deliberate increase in the thickness of one of the design layers
at the end of each of these procedures. Using the General
Information window, make sure that there is no design loaded into
RAM.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis menu, select the Gradual evolution design mode.
Ensure that a total optical thickness (TOT) of 8000 nm is
specified as the active termination criterion to trigger gradual
evolution. The high TOT value was chosen because we already know
that achieving high steepness of the transmittance in the target
transition regions is only possible at such values.</p>
<p>Also make sure that the SQP method is selected as the local
optimization method.</p>
<p>Click the Run button in the upper left corner of the window. The
progress of the gradual evolution design procedure is reflected in
the right, history part of the window.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes or less, the procedure ends because the
termination criterion has been reached. The final design provides
excellent compliance with the target characteristic. You can use
the History part of the window to see that a fairly good match to
the target transmittance is provided by many designs obtained in
the previous steps of the gradual evolution procedure. To see the
spectral transmittance of any of these designs, click on the
selected design.</p>
<p>You can save any selected design to the design database. To do
this, click the Load button in the lower right part of the window.
The selected design is now presented in the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation
window and you can save it in the design database using Data -&gt;
Save Data -&gt; Save Design option. Note that the design database
already contains previously obtained results.</p>
<p><strong>Note: An important feature of the gradual evolution design
procedure is that allows one to obtain not one, but a series of
solutions to the design problem with successively decreasing merit
function values. Using this series, you can choose your “most
practical solution to the design problem” based on a certain
compromise between the MF value and the complexity of the
design.</strong></p>
