<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the design of
chirped mirrors that must meet group delay dispersion (GDD)
targets along with the demand for high reflection. In addition,
the specification of spectral range targets is demonstrated.
Before starting the example, it is worth to recall that the group
delay (GD) and the group delay dispersion (GDD) are the first and
second derivatives of the phase with respect to the circular
frequency with a minus sign.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D14. Some datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46. In the target database, select the
target file <strong>Chirped mirror 700-900 nm GDD= -55 fs^2</strong> and choose
Edit to view the contents of this file. The target requirement is
for 100% reflectance in the 700-900 nm spectral range. In
addition, there is a target requirement for -55 fs^2 GDD in the
same spectral range.</p>
<p> Note that the tolerances (DGDDrs column) for assessing the
closeness of the GDD to this value are set to 1 fs^2. They are
chosen in such a way to assign approximately equal weights to the
two simultaneously specified requirements. There is also one more
target file that will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Load the target file Chirped mirror 700-900 nm GDD= -55 fs² into
the RAM and load the 49-layer quarter wave mirror QWM-49 at 800 nm
as a starting design. Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase and GD&amp;GDD windows to see
the match between the R and GDD of the starting design and the
target requirements. The loaded starting design has excellent
reflectance in the required spectral range, but the GDD is far
away from the specified target.</p>
<p>To see the GDD of the starting design you can choose the GDD scale
from -65 to 20 fs².</p>
<p>In the Synthesis -&gt; Options… select the SQP optimization method.
Select the Needle Optimization AUTO mode from the Synthesis menu
and click the Run button. The result of optimization is a 48-layer
design saved in the design database under the name CM by Needle
with SQP.</p>
<p>Click the Load button in the Needle optimization window to load
the obtained design into the General Information and Evaluation
windows. In the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window, change the R scale to 95-100%,
and in the GD&amp;GDD window, select the GDD scale from -65 to -45
fs². Note that the reflectance is below 99% at the left part of
the target spectral region, which should be avoided. The GD&amp;GDD
window shows fluctuations in the group delay dispersion. It can be
theoretically shown that such fluctuations are inevitable in the
high reflection region.</p>
<p>Knowing that GDD fluctuations are inevitable can help to
reformulate the design problem more realistically. If a certain
level of fluctuations is acceptable, then the design problem can
be set as follows. Let us design a mirror with the highest
possible reflectivity in the considered wavelength range, provided
that the GDD fluctuations do not exceed an acceptable level. The
acceptable level of the GDD fluctuations can be specified using
range spectral targets. An example of such a target is stored in
the target database under the name Range target from -58 to -52
fs². Use Edit tab to examine this target. It specifies the
acceptable GDD fluctuations of ±3 fs² from the initial target
value of -55 fs² .</p>
<p>Load the range target into RAM. Note that the MF value in the
lower left part of the Needle optimization window has been reduced
due to the new relaxed target requirements. Click the Run button
to start a new optimization procedure. The obtained design is
stored in the design database under the name CM by Needle with SQP
and range target. Click the Load button in the Needle optimization
window to load the obtained design into the General Information
and Evaluation windows. The T&amp;R&amp;Phase window shows that the
reflectance is now higher than 99.9% over the entire range from
700 to 900 nm. The GD&amp;GDD window shows that the GDD fluctuations
have increased, but they do not exceed the level specified by the
range target.</p>
