<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate that intensity
and phase properties of optical coatings are not completely
independent. There are situations where perfect matching of
intensity and phase targets cannot be achieved simultaneously due
to fundamental physical limitations.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D13. Some datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46. In the target database, there is a
target Mirror with constant phase. Select this file and use Edit
-&gt; Preview to see the target requirements. It is necessary to
design a high reflector with a target reflectance of 100% and a
constant phase shift on reflection of 180-degree in the spectral
region of 550-650 nm.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we will use a 21-layer quarter wave mirror
as the starting design. In the design database, select the file
QWM-21, c.w. 600 nm and load it. Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the
Analysis menu. There is already a fairly good agreement between
the reflectance and phase shift on reflection of the starting
design and the intensity and phase targets. The phase shift is
exactly 180-degree at the central wavelength of 600 nm, and it is
only necessary to make its wavelength dependence flat in the
target region.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis -&gt; Options… select the Newton optimization
method. Select the Needle Optimization AUTO mode from the
Synthesis menu and click the Run button. The result of
optimization is obtained in a few seconds.</p>
<p>You will see that when you try to reduce the slope of the phase
shift versus wavelength, the reflectance deteriorates
significantly. But due to this, only a practically insignificant
decrease in the steepness of the phase shift is achieved. You can
try other local optimization methods by accessing them through the
Options button at the bottom of the Needle AUTO window. If you
want to start with the same QWM-21… design as before, simply click
on that design in the History part of the Needle AUTO window.</p>
<p>You can save your own results in the design database. As a
reminder, to do this, you need to click the Load button in the
Needle AUTO window to bring this design to the T&amp;R&amp;Phase
evaluation window. You can then save the resulting design to the
design database using the Data -&gt; Save Data -&gt; Save Design option.</p>
<p> Note: There are already a couple of designs stored in this
database. You will see that all attempts to reduce the slope of
the phase shift versus wavelength have failed.</p>
<p>The reason for the failure to achieve a constant phase shift on
reflection is related to the fundamental limitation on the
steepness of the phase shift in the high reflection zone. It turns
out that this steepness cannot be below a certain limit,
determined by the refractive index of the outer mirror layer (A.
Tikhonravov, Optical coatings: design, characterization,
monitoring, SPIE Press, 2024).</p>
<p>The next example demonstrates the successful design of a phase
retarding mirror with the target requirements specified in the
target file HR with DPR. Here DPR means differential phase shift,
i.e. the difference between phase shifts on reflection for the s-
and p- polarized light. The target spectral characteristics are
specified on a wavelength grid with a step of 1 nm in the spectral
region from 1054 nm to 1074 nm and at an angle of incidence of
45°. The target s- and p- reflectances are 100% and the target
differential phase shift is 90°.</p>
<p>Such mirrors are used in industrial laser systems to convert a
linearly polarized laser beam into a circularly polarized laser
beam. Let us recall that there are two possible definitions of the
phase shift on reflection for p-polarized light, differing in
the sign of this phase shift. In OptiLayer we use a more logical
definition, from which it follows that the phase shifts on
reflection in the s- and p- cases coincide when the light
incidence tends to normal incidence.</p>
<p>Load the target file HR with DPR and the design file QWM-21 at
45-deg, c.w. 1064 nm as a starting design. The starting design is
a 21-layer quarter wave mirror, which reflectances and
differential phase shift can be viewed in the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window.
The differential phase shift of the starting design is close to
zero.</p>
<p>In the Refinement mode of the Synthesis menu, clear History,
select the Truncated Newton method, and click the Run button. The
resulting design has a differential phase shift very close to 90°.
This was achieved with a small reduction in p-reflectance of
approximately 1%.</p>
