<p>The main purpose of this example is to further demonstrate the
critical importance of the design total optical thickness to
achieve a good match to the target spectral characteristics.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D6. The substrate Glass n=1.52 and the layer materials n=2.35
and n=1.46 are already loaded into RAM. There are two items in the
target database. These are AR 400-1000 nm and Band pass filter.
Use the Preview option to view both targets. Load the AR target
into RAM.
** **</p>
<p>In the design database, there is a single layer starting design
H-layer TOT 400 nm with an optical thickness of 400 nm. Load this
design into RAM and open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window to see
the correspondence between the transmittance of the starting
design and the target transmittance.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis menu, select the Needle Optimization AUTO mode
and click the Run button in the upper left corner of its window.
In a fraction of a second, the final design is obtained. The
achieved merit function value (MF), number of design layers (N),
and total thickness of the design (TT) are shown in the top line
of the window representing the history of the needle optimization
procedure.</p>
<p>Make sure that in the Configuration-&gt; Settings optical thicknesses
are selected as Thickness units for the design representation.</p>
<p>To save the obtained design, click the Load button in the lower
right part of the window. The obtain design is now presented in
the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window and you can save it in the design
database using Data -&gt; Save Data -&gt; Save Design option.</p>
<p> Note that there is already the design 8-layer AR in the design
database that was previously obtained using the same starting
design. It has excellent antireflection properties in a wide
spectral region of 400-1000 nm.</p>
<p> Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design options and
random nature of some of their elements, the results obtained may
differ from those previously saved in the design database.</p>
<p>In the design database, select the starting design H-layer TOT 800
nm with an optical thickness of 800 nm and load it into RAM. Run
the Needle Optimization AUTO mode. The design with even better
antireflection properties is obtained – see the achieved merit
function value, number of design layers, and total thickness of
the design in the top line of the window representing the history
of the needle optimization procedure.</p>
<p>It is saved in the design database as a 16-layer AR design. It is
worth seeing the reflectances of both designs on a scale of a few
percent.</p>
<p>Let us now look at designing a band pass filter with the target
transmittance Band pass filter. Load this target file into RAM.
Try running the Needle Optimization AUTO procedure with both of
the starting designs used previously. The procedure does not allow
one to find a solution to the design problem under consideration.</p>
<p>Needle optimization Auto with the first starting design</p>
<p>Needle optimizaion Auto with the second starting design</p>
<p>The explanation to the failure of the needle optimization
procedure in both cases is that we do not have a starting design
with sufficient total optical thickness. There is a fundamental
difference between the previously considered AR target and the new
band pass filter target. The later have requirements for
transitions between high transmittance and high reflection in
narrow spectral regions around 500 nm and 600 nm. It has been
shown theoretically that such requirements can only be fulfilled
if the design total optical thickness is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>In the design database, there is a single layer starting design
H-layer TOT 4000 nm, which has ten times the optical thickness of
the design H-layer TOT 400 nm. Running the needle optimization
procedure with such a thick starting design and quasi-Newton
method immediately gives a fairly good band pass filter design.</p>
<p>It is saved in the design database as a 35-layer BPF by
quasi-Newton. Using an even thicker starting design H-layer TOT
6000 nm gives a filter design whose MF value is 4 times lower than
before. Examples of such designs are saved in the design database.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Once again, we see that the design total optical
thickness is an extremely important design parameter.</strong></p>
