<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the operation
of the local optimization methods available in OptiLayer. The
design of a short pass filter is used as an example, since in this
case it is possible to select a good starting design for running
the local optimization (refinement) procedures.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D4. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, the design QWM-21, c.w. 600 nm, and
the target Short wave pass filter. Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in
the Analysis menu. The transmittance of the 21-layer QWM is
displayed in the spectral range of 400 to 800 nm. The spectral
target is indicated by crosses.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis -&gt; Options… select the Modified DLS optimization
method.</p>
<p>Select the Refinement option from the Synthesis menu and click the
Run button. The result of optimization is obtained in a fraction
of a second.</p>
<p>Click the Load button at the bottom right of the Refinement window
to bring this design to the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window. You can
save the resulting design to the design database using the Data -&gt;
Save Data -&gt; Save Design option. You can give the saved design a
name and click OK.</p>
<p> Note that a similar result has already been stored in the design
database.</p>
<p>In Synthesis -&gt; Options… change Modified DLS method to the Newton
method.</p>
<p>Again, select the Refinement option and reload the same starting
design as before. Click the Run button. Once again, the
optimization result is obtained in a fraction of a second. Click
the Load button to bring this design to the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation
window. You can save the new obtained design to the design
database. Close the Refinement option.</p>
<p>Use your own results or previously saved results to compare the
designs obtained using different optimization methods.</p>
<p>In the T&amp;R&amp;Phase evaluation window you will see that both designs
have equally good spectral properties. However, the values of the
Merit function (MF), which evaluates their proximity to the
spectral target, are somewhat different. To ensure that the
designs are noticeably different, open the Thickness tab of the
Refractive Index Profile window of the Analysis menu and load the
designs one by one.</p>
<p>Design obtained with Modified DLS method:</p>
<p>Design obtained with Newthon method:</p>
<p>This example shows that due to the extremely complex structure of
the Merit function, different optimization method may converge on
different designs. Unfortunately, there is no universal
optimization method that would give the best results for all
design problems. In practice, it is worth trying different methods
to choose one that is most suitable for the specific problem being
considered.</p>
