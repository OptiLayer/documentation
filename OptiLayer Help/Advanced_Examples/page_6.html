<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the evaluation
of the intensity and phase spectral properties of QWM. In parallel
with this demonstration, it is shown how the designs in the RAM
can be modified and stored to the design database. The
introduction of the phase of the amplitude reflection coefficient
in the p-case is also discussed. It is shown that the p-phase in
OptiLayer is introduced in the most logical way.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D2. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the design QWM-19, c.w. 600 nm.</p>
<p>Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu. The transmittance
of the 19-layer QWM is displayed in the spectral range of 400 to
800 nm.</p>
<p>To check the change in mirror transmittance when changing the
number of mirror layer, go to the Synthesis -&gt; Modify Design
option and increase the number of design layers from 19 to 25.</p>
<p>Check that the design spreadsheet now has 25 rows. After clicking
OK, the changes are applied to the design in RAM.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Note that the steepness of the transmittance slopes at the
boundaries of the high reflection region has increased
considerably.</p>
<p>To save the modified mirror design to the design database stored
on the hard disk, select Data -&gt; Save Data -&gt; Save Design option.
Give the saved design a name and click OK. You can now see the new
design datafile in the Design database window.</p>
<p>Load the original 19-layer QWM into RAM. Let us study the
dependence of the mirror spectral characteristics on the angle of
incidence. For oblique light incidence, we should consider
characteristics for two polarization states, s- and p-states.
Right-click in the evaluation window and select the Plot -&gt; Plots
options.</p>
<p>Click the Add button to add new characteristics to display. Let us
choose reflectances and phase shifts on reflection for the s- and
p- polarized light at 45-degree light incidence (four plots). Use
different colors for s- and p- characteristics, solid and dashed
curves for intensity and phase characteristics.</p>
<p>We see that the phase shifts on reflection for the s- and
p-polarized light are the same at the wavelength in the center of
the high reflection zone. As the incidence tends toward normal
incidence, the s- and p-phases approach each other in a wide
wavelength range and then coincide at normal incidence. This can
be checked by changing the incidence angles to smaller values (for
example, 5-10 degrees) in the Plot options. Of course, this is to
be expected. But in some texts, the phase shifts on reflection for
the s- and p-polarized light differ by 180 degrees at normal
incidence.</p>
<p>This difference is caused by the different introduction of the
reflection phase in the p-case compared to OptiLayer. The example
discussed shows that the p-phase definition used in OptiLayer is
the most natural.</p>
