<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the results of
statistical error analysis with refractive index errors and to
show the benefit of monitoring optical thicknesses during the
coating production.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D17.  Datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46, and the design SWP-21, by
quasi-Newton.</p>
<p>Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu to see the
transmittance of this short-wave pass filter in the 400-700 nm
spectral range.</p>
<p>In the Analysis menu, select Errors-&gt; Error Analysis… option. In
the Error Analysis Setup window, use Characteristic tab to set the
analyzed spectral characteristic and statistical analysis
parameters. By default, the calculation of mathematical
expectation (M) and corridor of deviations (D) is enabled. This
means that at the end of the statistical analysis, the results of
individual error tests will be replaced by these statistical
characteristics.</p>
<p>In the Thickness tab, make sure errors in layer thicknesses are
set to zero and open the Refractive Index tab to set errors in
layer refractive indices. To set independent errors in layers of a
given material, the checkbox Per Material Errors should not be
checked. Otherwise, the same errors will be simulated in all
layers of a given material. Independent errors better reflect the
refractive index errors associated with random variations in films
density within the deposition chamber. It can be theoretically
shown (A. Tikhonravov, Optical coatings: design, characterization,
monitoring, SPIE Press, 2024) that changes in the reflectance and
transmittance are proportional to the ratio Δn/n’. Therefore, it
is advisable to consider the relative errors of the refractive
index. Let us set 2% relative errors in refractive indices of
high-index coating layers.</p>
<p>Click the Run button to start error analysis. As in the case of
thickness errors, the performed analysis shows a negligible
influence of errors on the spectral characteristic of the filter
in the high reflection region. This is a consequence of the
general theoretical result that refractive index errors cause only
small changes in the spectral characteristics of optical coatings
in regions of high reflectance compared to other regions.</p>
<p>In the above analysis, there were no errors in the layer
thicknesses, and these thicknesses were fixed at theoretically
planned values. It is advisable to check what happens if we fix
not physical but optical thicknesses. This can be done using the
checkbox Keep Optical Thicknesses. When it is checked, the
physical layer thicknesses are adjusted to maintain the
theoretically planned optical thicknesses.</p>
<p>To make the results of further analysis more visual, we will
increase the relative errors in the indices of H-layers from 2% to
4%. Run error analysis with the checkbox checked and unchecked. A
significant decrease in variations of the spectral transmittance
in the first case is clearly seen.</p>
<p>The experiment performed can serve as an argument in favor of
optical monitoring procedures, that control not the physical, but
the optical thicknesses of the coating layers. If there are
fluctuations in the refractive indices of the deposited layers,
then with such monitoring procedures the physical thicknesses of
the layers will be automatically adjusted to maintain the planned
optical thickness values.</p>
