<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database.
This example demonstrates the operation of a special optimization
technique used to design narrow band pass (NBP) filters with the
additional requirement that their layers have quarter wave or
multiple quarter wave optical thicknesses. This requirement allows
for a special monitoring approach called turning point optical
monitoring. Only thanks to this monitoring approach can one
successfully manufacture NBP filters with many dozens and hundreds
of layers.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D9. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52 and the
layer materials n=2.35 and n=1.46.</p>
<p>In the Synthesis menu, select the Filter Design… mode. It is
organized as a six-step dialog. The first step is to select the
layer materials used to design the filter. Most often, NBP filters
are two-component multilayers. In our case, two materials are
loaded into RAM and their selection has been already checked.</p>
<p>By clicking the Next button, we move on to the second dialog step,
where the parameters of the designed filter are set. We will
design a filter with the following parameters: filter central
wavelength of 600 nm, 1.5 nm halfwidth at the 89.13% transmittance
level (corresponding to an attenuation of 0.5 dB), 4.5 nm
halfwidth at the 0.1% transmittance level (corresponding to an
attenuation of 30 dB).</p>
<p>Click the Next button to move on to the third dialog step. At this
step the number of spacer layers (the number of filter cavities)
is set. The recommendation for this number follows from the theory
of Chebyshev filters. Based on the parameters set at the Step 2,
the required number of spacer layers is estimated at 4.</p>
<p>At the next, fourth step of the dialog, a filter prototype is
selected. The parameters of the filter prototypes are listed in
lines m and s of the Prototype Specification part of the Step 4
window. The m value corresponds to the number of layers of the
first (left) mirror of the prototype, and the s value indicates
the order of the spacer layers of the selected prototype. The
bottom line corresponds to the initial filter prototype, built
using the design approach proposed by Alfred Thelen in 1966. The
orders of all spacer layers of this prototype are always equal to
1. It is possible to specify a set of almost equivalent filter
prototypes with similar passband width. This is because there are
two ways to control the filter bandwidth: either by changing the
number of layers of filter mirrors, or by changing the orders of
the spacer layers. Increasing the orders of spacer layers while
reducing the number of mirrors layers makes it possible to obtain
other protypes with practically equivalent spectral properties.
Note that the transmittance of the selected filter prototype is
shown on the right side of the window.</p>
<p>After one of the filter prototypes has been selected, we move on
to the next, fifth dialog step. At this step, it is necessary to
optimize the filter parameters. These parameters are the numbers
of layers of quarter wave mirrors that make up the filter, and the
orders of the filter spacer layers. The optimized parameters are
integers, and a special integer optimization procedure is launched
when you click the Start button. The results obtained in the
course of integer optimization are reflected on the right side of
the Step 5 window.</p>
<p>Usually, good filter designs are obtained in a short time, and the
integer optimization procedure can be interrupted by clicking the
Stop button. Note that this is the same button that was in the
state Start before the procedure started. If this button is
already in the Start state, it means that integer optimization has
already completed. Now you can select any of the designs listed on
the right side of the window and proceed to the last sixth step of
the dialog.</p>
<p> Note that the integer optimization was performed under the
assumption that the incidence medium has the same refractive index
as the substrate.</p>
<p>At the last dialog step, the actual refractive index of the
incidence medium (usually Air) is considered. For this reason, the
resulting transmittance shows excellent target compliance, except
for 100% in the pass band region. It is not a problem to improve
the transmittance in the pass band region by applying a simple
antireflection coating at the top of the obtained design by
selecting this option.</p>
<p>Now the resulting design can be loaded into the General
Information window and the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window by clicking the Finish
button.</p>
<p> Note that all layers of the final design, except for the last
two, have a quarter-wave or a multiple of a quarter-wave optical
thickness. This ensures that turning point optical monitoring can
be applied to produce it.</p>
<p>Several examples of filter designs are stored in the Design
database.</p>
