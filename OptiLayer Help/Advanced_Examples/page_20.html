<p> Note: Due to the continuous improvement of OptiLayer design
options and random nature of some of their elements, the results
obtained may differ from those previously saved in the design
database</p>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the results of
statistical error analysis with uncorrelated thickness errors of
individual coating layers.</p>
<p>In the File -&gt; Project menu of OptiLayer, open the directory
LEC24D16. Some datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate Glass n=1.52, the layer
materials n=2.35 and n=1.46. In the design database, select the
file SWP-21, by quasi-Newton and load it.</p>
<p>Open the T&amp;R&amp;Phase option in the Analysis menu to see the
transmittance of this short-wave pass filter in the 400-700 nm
spectral range.</p>
<p>In the Analysis menu, select Errors-&gt; Error Analysis… option. In
the Error Analysis Setup window, use Characteristic tab to set the
analyzed spectral characteristic and statistical analysis
parameters. By default, the calculation of mathematical
expectation (M) and corridor of deviations (D) is enabled. This
means that at the end of the statistical analysis, the results of
individual error tests will be replaced by these statistical
characteristics.</p>
<p>Use Thickness tab to set levels of errors in layer thicknesses.
Recall that in this option we consider uncorrelated thickness
errors of individual layers. It is possible to consider two types
of such errors, which are called additive and relative thickness
errors. The level of errors of the first type does not depend of
the layer thickness, and the level of errors of the second type is
proportional to the layer thickness. We assume that in both cases
the mathematical expectations of errors are equal to zero. In this
case, the level of errors is determined by the standard
deviation σ of the normal distribution: randomly generated errors
will be within the corridor from -σ to +σ  with a probability of
68.2%. The standard deviation is called the level of thickness
errors. In the case of additive thickness errors, we set the level
of thickness errors directly in nanometers (Layer Errors Abs
field). In the case of relative errors, their level is set as a
percentage of the thicknesses of the respective layers (Layer
Errors Rel field). For example, a relative error of 1% means that
the standard deviation σ is 2 nm for a 200 nm layer and 0.5 nm for
a 50 nm layer.</p>
<p>Error levels can be the same for all coating layers (Coating tab),</p>
<p>the same for layers of a given material (Material tab),</p>
<p>or set individually for each coating layer (Thickness tab).</p>
<p>Let us set 1% relative errors for all coating layers. Click the
Run button to start error analysis. Because the calculations are
fast and plotting a large number of individual error test results
can cause confusion on the screen, you will see the final
statistical characteristics of M (Exp) and D.</p>
<p>To view the results of individual error tests, you can specify a
Pause after each plot in seconds.</p>
<p>A notable result of the performed analysis is the insignificant
influence of layer thickness errors on the spectral characteristic
of the filter in the high reflection region. There is a general
theoretical result stating that errors in layer thicknesses cause
only small changes in the spectral characteristics of optical
coatings in regions of high reflectance compared to other regions.</p>
<p>To run the second example, load the design 66-layer 4-cavity NBF
at 600 nm. In the T&amp;R&amp;Phase window, set the wavelength range to
585-615 nm. You will see the transmittance of a narrow band pass
filter with a central wavelength of 600 nm and a 50% passband
width of about 4 nm.</p>
<p>The filter has steep transmittance slopes, which is due to its
special structure. This is a four-cavity filter that can be seen
using the Refractive Index Profile window.</p>
<p>Let us run the Error Analysis with the same parameters as before,
that is, with 1% relative errors for all coating layers. Click the
Run button to start error analysis. The statistical
characteristics of M (Exp) and D show that at this level of errors
the spectral properties of the filter are completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Reduce the relative error level from 1% to 0.1%, set the Number of
tests to 20 and the Pause after each plot to 1 second.</p>
<p>Run the Error Analysis mode again. The results of individual error
tests are still completely unsatisfactory.</p>
<p> Note that a relative error level of 1% corresponds to an additive
thickness error level of about 0.1 nm or less. It is therefore
obvious that multicavity filters of the type in question cannot be
manufactured using time or quartz crystal monitoring. The only way
to successfully manufacture such filters is to use turning point
optical monitoring, which provides self-compensation for thickness
errors in different coating layers.</p>
