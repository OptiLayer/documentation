<p>All necessary files for this exercise are located in the directory
EX2. Select this directory using the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem</a> menu command.  In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>First, load the Substrate GLASS into memory.</p>
<p>Zinc sulfide and thorium fluoride are the high and low index layer
materials used in this example.  Both materials are considered to
be dispersive.  Enter the <a class="reference external" href="idh_database.html">Layer Material</a>
database and examine the ZNS file, dispersive properties of this
material are specified in a tabular form:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex2_mat.png" /></p>
<p>Similarly, THF4 file defines the low index material that has
dispersion and absorption. Use Edit command of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_database.html">Layer
Material</a> database to examine this file. Note
that Preview tab allows to observe data in graphical form.</p>
<p>Load both materials. They will get abbreviations H and L, as it
was discussed in the previous Exercise.</p>
<p>Switch to the Design database and try to load QWM design. You will
get “Material A is not loaded!” error message. Open QWM file with
the help of the Edit command and note that this file uses material
abbreviation A for all even layers. Corresponding fields for
physical thicknesses are disabled and have zero values. This means
that the corresponding layer material is not loaded to memory and
OptiLayer is not able to calculate the layer physical thicknesses
basing on optical thicknesses. Indeed, we have only H and L
materials in memory.</p>
<p>Go to the <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_material.html">Arrange
Materials</a> command of Data
menu. This dialog also can be accessed through Analysis-&gt;Options
command. Change the abbreviation of THF4 material from L to A.
Open again the Design Editor if it was closed and notice that now
all physical thicknesses are available. Load the QWM design to the
memory (it is a 12 layer quarter-wave mirror with the control
wavelength 2000nm).</p>
<p>Open the Evaluation window and select plotting range (X-axis) from
500nm to 3000nm. Set also R (reflectance) as plotted
characteristic. Two high-reflection zones will be displayed in the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation window</a>. Activate HiRes option
to use more spectral points for plotting, it makes plots more
accurate at the expense of increasing plotting time.</p>
<p>Use the <a class="reference external" href="idh_configuration.html">General Configuration</a> dialog
to change wavelength and T, R units. Changes are reflected
immediately in all opened windows. Corresponding units are also
shown in the Units section of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_general_information_window.html">General Information
Window</a>.</p>
