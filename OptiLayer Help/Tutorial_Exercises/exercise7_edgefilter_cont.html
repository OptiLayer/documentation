<p>The final design of the previous exercise features considerable
oscillations of the reflectance in the high transmission zone,
especially in the neighborhood of 560nm.  The reason for these
oscillations is that the transition zone between the regions of
high and low reflection, specified by the target function, is too
narrow.  To improve the properties of the reflectance in the high
transmission region it is necessary to modify the target function.</p>
<p>Select the <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem directory</a> EX7.
 In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF Mode</a> you need to use Import
Problem Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load substrate GLASS, layer materials SIO2 and TIO2, and the
starting design QWM.</p>
<p>Go to the Target database. You will find two target files with the
names Ef-swp and Ef-swp mod. Compare these files with the help of
Edit command in the Target database. It is possible to open both
files simultaneously and to place <a class="reference external" href="target_editor.html">Target
Editor</a> windows side-by-side. Note that
Ef-swp mod target has wider transition zone between low and high
reflection regions (25nm).</p>
<p>Target files are opened in the corresponding editors but are not
loaded to memory. Due to this reason the Refinement command of the
Synthesis menu is unavailable (grayed). Load the Target file
Ef-swp mod to memory, choose the Newton method (<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and
Synthesis Options</a> dialog)
and execute the <a class="reference external" href="idh_refinement.html">Refinement</a> procedure.
This time the final design will have a merit function value of
7.003406E-001. The improvement of the reflectance is readily
visible on the screen.</p>
<p>You may want to save the design we have just obtained. There are
several ways to do this. The first way is to output the result in
the form of an ASCII file creating <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_results.html">Current Design
Report</a>.  The second way is to save the
result in the Design database (this function is disabled in the
DEMO version). The second way is recommended when you want to save
the result for further computations.  Any design stored in the
Design database can be easily loaded into memory for further use.
To save the result in the Design database, go to the Data menu and
select <a class="reference external" href="idh_save_database_file.html">Save Design</a> item. The
obtained design was already saved for the sake of comparison (file
name EF20SW).</p>
