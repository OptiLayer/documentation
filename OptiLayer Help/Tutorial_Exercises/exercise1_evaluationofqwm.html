<p>All necessary files for this exercise are located in the directory
EX1. Select this directory using the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem</a> menu command.  In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Open the Substrate database in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_data.html">Data
menu</a> and <a class="reference external" href="idh_loading_data.html">Load</a>
file GLASS as a substrate. Using the bottom tabs in the Database
dialog switch to the Layer Materials database and load MGF2 and
ZNS as layer materials. After this switch to the Design database
and load QWM as a design. In every database you can use the Edit
command in order to check data inside each file. Data can be
examined in both numerical and graphical forms (Preview page of
corresponding editors).</p>
<p>Check the state of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_general_information_window.html">General Information
window</a>, that should look
as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/geninfoex1.png" /></p>
<p>OptiLayer assumes that the default for the incident medium is air
and loads the Air file automatically.  You need to specify and
load the refractive index of the incident medium only if this
medium differs from air. Note that the same database is used to
store refractive indices of substrates and the incident media.</p>
<p>In this example zinc sulfide and magnesium fluoride layer
materials are non-dispersive for the sake of simplicity and have
refractive indices 2.30 and 1.38, respectively. Note that after
loading the first file, its name, accompanied by the character
abbreviation H, appears in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_general_information_window.html">General Information
Window</a>.  After loading of
the second file you can see both names in the General Information
Window with the character abbreviations H and L (high and low)
automatically assigned to the names in accordance with their
refractive indices values. These  character abbreviations are used
in the design descriptions.</p>
<p>Examine the QWM design file using the Edit command of the Design
database. This is a 12 layer quarter-wave mirror with the control
wavelength 500nm. Refer to the <a class="reference external" href="idh_design_editor.html">Design
Editor</a> help for more details.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the link between the loaded layer
materials data files and character abbreviations used in the
design description is performed when the design is loaded from the
disk to memory.</p>
<p>The connection between character abbreviations H and L and
specific layer materials which have been loaded into memory is
indicated in the General Information window. The refractive
indices of these materials at the design control wavelength are
used to connect design physical thicknesses with the design
optical thicknesses specified in the design description.</p>

<p>Open Evaluation window with the help of <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Analysis-&gt;T &amp; R &amp;
Phase</a> command. Make experiments with
various plotting options using the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options.html">Analysis-&gt;Options</a> dialog. For
quick access to these options it is possible to use right-click
pop up menu of the Evaluation window.</p>
<p>It is recommended to experiment with:</p>
<p>·Axis ranges and types (linear/logarithmic)</p>
<p>·Plotted characteristics (it is possible to use up to 50 various
plots in each Evaluation window)</p>
<p>·Lines styles (solid, dotted, dashed, etc.) and colors</p>
<p>·Appearance of the design bar</p>
<p>·Legend and header settings.</p>
<p>For advanced use note that there is an ability to open <a class="reference external" href="additionalevaluationwindows.html">additional
Evaluation</a> windows. As an
example, use Analysis -&gt; Additional option to display the main
high reflection zone and intermediate zone separately as presented
below. Both windows are displayed simultaneously and use different
X- and Y-axis settings.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/addev1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/addev2.png" /></p>
<p>Use the <a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_design.html">Modify Design</a> command in the
Synthesis menu to make in-memory design modifications. Note that
modifications are instantly reflected in the both Evaluation
windows. All windows in OptiLayer are synchronized. This means
that changes are reflected immediately everywhere. There is only
one exception from this rule. Report windows created using the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_results.html">Results menu</a> reflect the state of
OptiLayer at the moment of the creation of the corresponding
report.</p>
