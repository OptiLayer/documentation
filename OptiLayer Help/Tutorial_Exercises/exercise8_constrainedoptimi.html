<p>All layers of the short wave-pass designs in two previous examples
have different thicknesses. Sometimes it may be desirable to
obtain a design with quarter-wave optical thicknesses of many
design layers.  This can be done in a rather simple way with the
help of constrained optimization.</p>
<p>OptiLayer provides several options for constrained optimization.
This exercise demonstrates the most simple case when thicknesses
of some design layers are fixed with the help of Status column in
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_design_editor.html">Design Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Select the <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem directory</a> EX8.
 In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF Mode</a> you need to use Import
Problem Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load substrate GLASS, layer materials SIO2 and TIO2, target file
Ef-swp mod, starting design QWM 4 Active Layers. Comparing to the
starting design of the previous exercise, QWM 4 Active Layers file
is slightly different. Using <a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_design.html">Modify
Design</a> option in the Synthesis menu
check that it has character A in the Status column only for the
first two layers and for the last two layers. This means that only
4 layer thicknesses will be changed during Refinement, all other
thicknesses with the Status F will remain constant.</p>
<p>Choose the Newton method (<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and Synthesis
Options</a> dialog) and start
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_refinement.html">Refinement procedure</a>. The resulting
design will have a merit function value of 5.278055E+000. It is
not surprising that the result is not as good as in the previous
exercise, because only four layers were allowed to vary in the
course of the refinement procedure.</p>
<p>Repeat this exercise using QWM 6 Active Layers starting design.
Now thicknesses of six layers are allowed to vary during the
refinement procedure. The improvement of the final design can be
clearly seen. The merit function value is now 3.117707E+000. This
result is saved with the file name EF20SW2.</p>
