<p>OptiLayer exploits the needle optimization technique in its
genuine form. This technique is based on complicated mathematical
ideas and computational algorithms. You can refer to the book
“Basics of Optics of Multilayer Systems” by  Sh.Furman and
A.Tikhonravov for its foundations (See
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.optilayer.com">www.optilayer.com</a>).</p>
<p>From a heuristic point of view, the needle optimization is
described as a process of  inserting thin new layers inside a
multilayer stack.  After the insertion of each new layer, the
number of layers in the stack is generally increased by two, i.e.,
a single layer has been divided into two pieces separated by a
“new” thin layer which was inserted in it.  The resulting stack is
then refined by one of the available optimization algorithms.</p>
<p>There are two operational modes for the <a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle
Optimization</a> procedure:</p>
<p>1.<a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization_dialog.html">Manual Needle
Optimization</a> mode which
allows the user to control all steps of the needle optimization
procedure.</p>
<p>2.<a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle Optimization AUTO</a>
mode which combines insertions of the needle layers and refinement
cycles in an integrated process.</p>
<p>The AUTO mode provides an access to a fully automated process
which continues consecutive needle insertions and refinement steps
until an optimal design is obtained, i.e., a design in which the
insertion of new layers no longer results in a decreasing merit
function.  It is suggested that initial use be constrained to the
AUTO mode.  The “Needle optimization” mode will most often be used
in situations where the user has developed specific strategies for
complicated synthesis problems.</p>
<p>The files required for the Exercise 11 are located in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem
directory</a> EX11. In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load GLASS substrate, SIO2 and TIO2 layer materials, and Ar-vis
target. Target has 20 logarithmically distributed spectral points
in the range from 400 to 800 nm. All files are the same as in the
<a class="reference external" href="exercise10_randomoptimizati.html">Exercise 10</a>.</p>
<p>We shall use a file SOMETHING as a “starting design.” This file
defines a 2-layer coating with layer physical thicknesses equal to
200nm, H material of the first layer and L material of the second
layer.</p>
<p>Open the <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation</a> window and set the
range of the y-axis to be from 0 to 4%. This will allow monitoring
the changes of the reflectance curve in more detail.</p>
<p>Choose the Newton method (<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and Synthesis
Options</a> dialog) and start
the Needle Optimization AUTO procedure
(<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_synthesis.html">Synthesis</a> menu). The convergence of
the process is fast at modern computers, and very quickly you will
obtain the following 8 layer AR coating:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex11_ev1.png" /></p>
<p>The choice of a starting design is not critical for the needle
optimization procedure. This means that you will always get high
quality results. Nevertheless with another “starting design” you
may obtain a different solution. Load the file SOMETHING 2 from
the Design database and repeat the Needle Optimization AUTO
procedure. You will get a 14-layer AR coating with the merit
function value of 0.1890181E-001.</p>
<p>The new design has the merit function value which is nearly two
times less than in the previous case. At the same time the new
design is thicker and has more design layers. The ability to
easily obtain a set of designs with different combinations of
major design parameters is one of the most attractive features of
the needle optimization procedure. This ability provides the
designer with an additional flexibility in choosing most practical
design.</p>

<p>As a last part of the Exercise 11 note that the layer number 12 of
the last 14-layer design is quite thin (you can examine this layer
using the <a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_design.html">Modify Design</a> command in the
Synthesis menu). It is often desirable to remove such layers from
the final design. You can do this with the help of <a class="reference external" href="idh_remove_thin_layers.html">Thin Layer
Removal</a> option. Go to this option
in the Synthesis menu and remove the layer number 12. Confirm the
prompt for the refinement procedure. You will get a new 12-layer
design with the merit function value of 0.1903152 which differs
very little from the previous value.</p>
