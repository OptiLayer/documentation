<p>All necessary files for this exercise are located in the directory
EX3. Select this directory using the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem</a> menu command.  In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load the Substrate GLASS file into memory. Load also SIO2 and ZRO2
files from the <a class="reference external" href="idh_database.html">Layer Material</a> database.
They will get abbreviations L and H correspondingly.</p>
<p>Enter the <a class="reference external" href="idh_design.html">Design database</a> and examine the
file with the name AR-2HL.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex3_ar.png" /></p>
<p>This design can be described by the formula 2H 1L &#64; 500nm. Remind
that layers are numbered starting from the substrate. Load this
design into memory and perform T, R evaluation. Set X-axis scale
from 300 to 900nm, T,R-axis from 0 to 10% and select R
(reflectance) as plotted characteristic. The Evaluation window
will look as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex3_ar_ev.png" /></p>
<p>In order to better understand the role of character abbreviations,
 load the MGF2 file. It will get the abbreviation A. Check this
with the help of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_general_information_window.html">General
Information</a> window.</p>
<p>Enter the <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_material.html">Arrange
Materials</a> item in the Data
menu, a window will be displayed where  abbreviation assignments
can be changed. Change the abbreviation of SIO2 to M, and the
abbreviation of MGF2 to L. Note that the plot at the Evaluation
window has not been changed. Create the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_results.html">Current Design
Report</a> (Results menu) and check that the
design now is represented as 2.0H 1.0M.  This means that the
material of the second layer is the same as before, yet the
abbreviation has been changed.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the relationship between the design
layer materials denoted by character abbreviations and layer
materials loaded in memory.  The link between the loaded materials
and the design material abbreviations occurs when the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_loading_data.html">Load</a> command is executed. To illustrate
this, load the AR-2HL design again and note that the reflectance
plot has been changed. This is because the first material of the
design in memory is still ZRO2 as before, but the second material
has been changed to MGF2 . If you examine the Design edit Window
you will see that the physical thickness of the second layer is
now 90.58nm instead of 86.21nm as before.  The physical thickness
has been changed when a new material, i.e., MGF2 has been linked
with the second layer.</p>
