<p>In many cases it is difficult to find a suitable starting design
for the refinement procedure.  In such cases it may be useful to
carry out a sequence of optimization procedures with random
starting designs. The <a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization.html">Random
optimization</a> option is intended
for this purpose. Because of highly efficient optimization
algorithms used in OptiLayer, this design approach often provides
good results.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this option of OptiLayer we shall design a set of
anti-reflection coatings for the visible spectral range. Required
files are located in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem
directory</a> EX10. In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load GLASS substrate, SIO2 and TIO2 layer materials, and Ar-vis
target. Target has 20 logarithmically distributed spectral points
in the range from 400 to 800nm.</p>
<p>Start the <a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization.html">Random optimization</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_synthesis.html">Synthesis</a> menu) and specify in the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization_parame.html">Random Optimization
Parameters</a> window 10
layers and Average optical thicknesses 50nm for the both materials
(Av.Opt.Th column). The Random optimization procedure starts after
clicking the OK button. This is a potentially infinite sequence of
cycles consisting of automatic generations of random starting
designs followed by optimization procedures. After each cycle a
new local minimum of the merit function is found, the resulting
design is analyzed and stored by OptiLayer.</p>
<p>OptiLayer stores up to 100 best designs in a special storage named
<a class="reference external" href="idh_collection.html">Collection</a>.  The designs are ordered
according to their merit function values. It often happens that
some results are obtained  several times, in such cases the
repeated result is discarded.</p>
<p>To generate layer thicknesses of random starting designs,
OptiLayer uses random numbers which are uniformly distributed in
the interval from 0.0 to twice the average value which was entered
in the Random Optimization Parameters window.</p>
<p>In many cases it is advisable to set up a Random optimization
procedure by specifying a rather large number of layers and
relatively small average layer thicknesses. As a general rule the
number of layers specified in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization_parame.html">Random Optimization
Parameters</a> window will be
reduced during the optimization process.  Since the process is a
random one designs saved in the Collection will have different
numbers of layers. This may be helpful for choosing the most
practical design basing on the designers personal opinion about
the most suitable combination of three major design parameters
indicated in the Collection window (merit function value, number
of design layers, and design total thickness).</p>
<p>Once started, the Random optimization procedure will run
indefinitely until explicit termination. After the termination the
best obtained result will be automatically loaded from the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_collection.html">Collection</a> storage.</p>
<p>Because of the stochastic nature of the Random optimization
procedure we can not predict exactly what results you will obtain.
In our case the Collection window looks as follows.</p>

<p>Note that you can analyze the contents of the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_collection.html">Collection</a> in more detail after finishing
the Random optimization procedure. To analyze any design use the
Extract button.</p>
