<p>The objective of this exercise is to obtain a long wave-pass
filter with a high reflection zone from 0.4 to 0.8 microns and a
the low reflection zone from 0.8 to 1.4 micron, otherwise known as
a cold mirror. This exercise is used to demonstrate some basic
concepts related to the choice of starting design and target
function.</p>
<p>After selection of EX9 <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem
directory</a> go to the Options command
of the Configuration menu and select microns as Length and
Spectral units in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_units.html">Units tab</a> of the
General Configuration dialog. Â In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load GLASS substrate, SIO2 and TIO2 layer materials.</p>
<p>First, we will use target function Cm with evenly distributed
spectral points. Browse this file located in the Target database
and load it to memory.</p>
<p>We shall start refinement with a quarter-wave mirror as a starting
design (file QWM). Load it and open the <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation
window</a>. You can see that the
high-reflection zone of our starting design is more narrow than
that specified by the target function. Choose the Newton method
(<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and Synthesis
Options</a> dialog) and perform
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_refinement.html">Refinement procedure</a>. We see that the
obtained solution is not good. Note that the refinement is a local
optimization technique which converges to the design which is
rather close to the starting one. In other words this technique
allows finding only local minima of the merit function. In order
to obtain better solution with the help of the refinement
procedure one needs to use better starting design.</p>

<p>At the moment let us use a combination of three quarter-wave
mirrors as a starting design in order to provide high reflectance
in the spectral region from 0.4 micron to 0.8 micron. We shall use
a combination of three mirrors with control wavelengths of 0.65
micron, 0.55 micron and 0.48 micron. This starting design is
specified in the file CM START in the Design database. Load this
file and compare starting design reflectance with the target
reflectance using the <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation window</a>.
Perform the Refinement procedure. We get a solution that has lower
merit function value comparing to the previous case. The result is
a 23-layer design with a merit function value of 3.689116E+000.</p>

<p>In the Evaluation window one can observe multiple ripples of the
design reflectance in the high-transmission zone. Quite often such
ripples are connected with incorrect choice of a target function.
This is just the case in our exercise. The wavelength grid used to
specify target function is too sparse. Thus a new target function
with more dense wavelength grid should be used. It is also
necessary to note that non-uniform wavelength grids are preferable
in the case of wideband spectral regions. Such grids should be
more dense in a short wavelength region.</p>
<p>OptiLayer has convenient options allowing generation of
non-uniform wavelength grids. These options are accessible through
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_grid_generator.html">Grid Generator</a> command of the
Edit menu. Such target can be found in the Target database. It has
a name Cm40log. Open this file using the Edit command and make
sure that the wavelength grid is more dense in a short wavelength
region. There is one more specific feature of this new target.
Note that target tolerances (DRs% column) are set equal to 10 at
two wavelength points near the transition zone between high and
low reflectance region. Target tolerances are also used to
automatically construct OptiLayer merit functions. High tolerances
decrease a relative weight of the discrepancy between actual and
target reflectances in calculating merit function value.</p>
<p>Load Cm40log target file and CM START starting design to memory.</p>
<p>After running Refinement procedure you will obtain 23-layer design
with MF=3.350604E+000. This design is saved in the Design database
with the name COLDMIR.</p>
