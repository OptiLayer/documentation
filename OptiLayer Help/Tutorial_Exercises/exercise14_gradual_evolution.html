<p>Optimization procedures provided by OptiLayer enable a wide range
of synthesis strategies for solving complicated design problems.
Accumulating experience with the program will allow you to devise
your own strategies. Exercises of this Section give you some basic
ideas on how one can organize a synthesis procedure. This exercise
also supplies some additional information on OptiLayer features.</p>
<p>Consider the design of wideband AR coatings for the spectral
region from 400 to 1200nm. Necessary files are located in the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem directory</a> EX14. In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load GLASS substrate, SIO2 and TIO2 layer materials to memory.
Browse and load Ar-vnir target from the Target database. To design
required AR coating we will not use any starting design at all.</p>
<p>Choose the Newton method (<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and Synthesis
Options</a> dialog). Go to the
Synthesis menu and choose the <a class="reference external" href="idh_gradual_evolution.html">Gradual
Evolution</a> command. The Gradual
Evolution Setup window provides a choice of several termination
conditions for the gradual evolution design process.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex14_gradevsetup.png" /></p>
<p>Limit the maximum number of layers by 25 and disable other
termination conditions as shown in the figure. Press the OK
button. The Gradual Evolution process starts running.</p>
<p>This process is a further development of the needle optimization
procedure and you will be able to observe a sequence of needle
optimization procedures at your screen. It also comprises a
consecutive increase of the design total optical thickness which
results in the obtaining not one but a sequence of designs with
different combinations of major design parameters. These designs
are accumulated in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_history.html">History</a> storage.</p>
<p>The Gradual Evolution process terminates as soon as an active
termination condition is reached. In our case this happens when
the number of design layers reaches 26. Note that it is possible
that the last needle optimization procedure has not been yet
completed at the termination moment. This last procedure will
automatically proceed running in a few seconds unless you answer
No when the termination prompt arrives at the screen. In our case
the final design after the last needle optimization procedure will
have 28 layers:</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex14_gradev.png" /></p>
<p>Note that this design as well as all intermediate designs stored
in the History were obtained even without any starting design at
all. It is important that in the course of Gradual Evolution
intermediate designs have been stored in the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_history.html">History</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/ex14_ev_hist.png" /> <img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex14_ev_hist_ch.png" /></p>
<p>You can extract and investigate these designs using the Extract
button in the History window. The History storage allows the
designer to compare the quality of design performance expressed by
the merit function value and the design complexity expressed by
its number of layers and design total thickness and thus to choose
the most practical design for manufacture.</p>
