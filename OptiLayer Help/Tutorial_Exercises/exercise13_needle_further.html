<p>In this exercise we shall consider the design of a coating with
non-standard spectral properties.  The target function for this
exercise was considered by Li Li and J.Dobrowolski (Applied
Optics, 1992, vol. 31, pp. 3790-3799).</p>
<p>Necessary files for this exercise are located in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_problem_directory.html">Problem
directory</a> EX13. In <a class="reference external" href="single_file_mode.html">SF
Mode</a> you need to use Import Problem
Directory command (<a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>).</p>
<p>Load GLASS substrate, and layer materials with the names 1.35 and
2.35 to memory (the names of layer materials correspond to their
refractive index values).</p>
<p>As a supplementary exercise you can experiment with the OptiLayer
option intended for entering numerical data from any ASCII file.
If you don’t want to do this, then go directly to the next
paragraph. To experiment with <a class="reference external" href="idh_import.html">ASCII import
function</a> examine first the ASCII file
Target.dat located in the same directory EX13. This file contains
data for the Li Li and J.Dobrowolski target function. Note, that
wavelength data in the Target.dat file are in microns while
transmittance data are in absolute units, so it is necessary to
set <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_units.html">units</a> in OptiLayer Configuration
menu accordingly. Create a new file with any name using the New
button in the Target database, specify the number of spectral
points in the target spreadsheet equal to 36 as in the Target.dat
ASCII file and then follow Help directions on <a class="reference external" href="idh_import.html">Data
Import</a> (F9) and <a class="reference external" href="idh_paste_buffer.html">Paste
Buffer</a> (F10).</p>
<p>For your convenience the required target function is provided in
the Target database under the name Exotic. Load this file into
memory. In the <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_thickness_units.html">Thickness
Units</a> section of the
Configuration dialog switch both Thickness Units and Design Bar
Display options to Optical Thickness.</p>
<p>Choose the Newton method (<a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">Analysis and Synthesis
Options</a> dialog).</p>
<p>Since the target function has a high reflection zone, we will try
a quarter-wave mirror as a starting design. Load the QWM 10 layers
file and run the <a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle Optimization
AUTO</a> procedure. As a result you
should obtain the 11-layer design with the merit function value of
5.345881.</p>
<p>In order to obtain better result it is necessary to use thicker
starting designs. Load the QWM 20 layers file and repeat the
<a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle Optimization AUTO</a>
procedure. Much better solution will be obtained.</p>
<p>You can repeat Needle Optimization AUTO procedure with the same
starting design using different <a class="reference external" href="idh_synthesis_options_method.html">optimization
methods</a>, results will be
quite often different. This is connected with very complicated
multi-extremal nature of thin film synthesis problems. One of
often obtained solutions is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex13_ev1.png" /></p>
<p>As an alternative you can use a coating with large number of
layers as a starting design. Load the 50 LAYERS file from the
Design database and repeat the <a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle Optimization
AUTO</a> procedure.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of this exercise is that the performance of a
coating is improving with growing design total optical thickness.
To check this you can run the Needle Optimization procedure again
with various starting designs and watch the total optical
thickness value (Th=) indicated at the design bar in the bottom
part of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_evaluation.html">Evaluation</a> window. Another
conclusion is that the total optical thickness is rather
conservative parameter that is only slightly varying in the course
of the Needle Optimization procedure. So thicker starting designs
generally result in better solutions. On the other hand, starting
design should not be too thick, because a resulting coating can be
too complicated for manufacture.</p>
<p>The recognition of the key role of design total optical thickness
has resulted in the development of a new OptiLayer synthesis
strategy that is called Gradual Evolution. Go to the <a class="reference external" href="exercise14_gradual_evolution.html">next
Exercise</a> to experience this
strategy.</p>
