<p>OptiLayer software family covers all steps of the design and
manufacturing cycle. It consists of three main modules: OptiLayer
(design and evaluation), OptiChar (optical characterization of a
single thin film), OptiRE (post-production characterization of
multilayers and reverse engineering). All modules are compatible
on the database level and can easily exchange data.</p>
<p>OptiLayer software uses multithreaded computations. This allows
the user to interact with the software (input data, edit data,
prepare reports, etc.) without interrupting computations. All
programs of the OptiLayer software family have a convenient
user-friendly interface with independent desktop windows. The user
will quickly recognize the convenience of this feature when
discovering the potential of multithreaded computations or using
other applications in parallel with OptiLayer. Live real-time
graphics are used to reflect all computational processes. This
makes design, analysis, and characterization processes vivid and
significantly increases the user’s ability to monitor and control
software operation.</p>
<p>OptiLayer, a computer program for the design and analysis of
optical thin films, was created by Prof. Alexander Tikhonravov. It
is based on more than thirty years of practical experience of a
big group of researchers who are directly involved in all aspects
of optical coating characterization, design, and manufacture. This
program combines a new mathematical treatment based on a unique
set of algorithms and a highly professional, user-friendly
interface. Many distinguishing features make OptiLayer a
tremendously powerful design tool. These include the use of
extremely efficient optimization methods based on the author’s
analytical know-how, special non-local synthesis techniques
invented by the authors, entirely new automated techniques for the
design of telecommunication filters, and many more.</p>
<p>The program provides a wide range of opportunities for the design
and analysis of coatings with dispersive and absorbing optical
materials. Both analysis and synthesis can be carried out over
various angles of light incidence and various spectral ranges. The
program enables the user to create their own databases for layer
materials, substrates, designs of various types, target functions,
etc. A set of commands allows the user to collect and save results
of calculations and to output results in the most convenient form.
OptiLayer has a software utility that allows the extraction of
numerical data from any ASCII file. This utility makes OptiLayer
compatible with various commercial software packages and the
user’s own software.</p>
<p>Due to the carefully elaborated interface, the user can easily
start using the program with minimal references to the manual. The
manual concentrates on specific options of the program, not
overloading the text with well-known details. Standard Windows
options are considered in less detail.</p>
