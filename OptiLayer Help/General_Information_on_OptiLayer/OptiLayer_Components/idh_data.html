<p>Here is the breakdown of how OptiLayer handles data storage and
management:
Decentralized Data Storage (Default Mode):
  - OptiLayer stores databases containing user data on the hard
disk.
  - Data related to specific problems can be stored in separate
directories with corresponding specific names called Problem
directories.
  - This decentralized data storage is convenient for
investigating multiple design or characterization problems
simultaneously or when used by multiple users.
File Transfer Option:
  - Enables the transfer of data files between different problem
directories, reducing the time needed for data preparation.
  - For example, substrate data files for various types of glass
can be transferred from the Catalog directory.
Backup/Restore Option:
  - Allows the creation of a backup file (*.zip file) for any
Problem directory and restoration on the same or different
computers running OptiLayer.
  - Facilitates data exchange between users and computers.
Loading Data for Analysis or Synthesis:
  - Before starting calculations, all necessary data, including
substrate and incident medium information, optical materials of
thin films, and design description, must be loaded into memory.
  - If the procedure involves optimizing a merit function, the
desired coating spectral response (target) must also be provided.
  - Data files containing this information are stored in databases
accessible from the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_data.html">Data menu</a>.
Databases Accessible from the Data Menu:
  - Target, Color Target, Light Source, Detector, Cone Angle,
Substrate, Layer Material and Design are commands that access
databases in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_data.html">Data menu</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Groups of database files:</p>
<p class="p-heading4indentnobefore rubric" id="target-files">Target files</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="target_editor.html">target</a> in OptiLayer is a set of values for
one or more spectral characteristics that define the desired optical
properties of a coating over a specific spectral band. A <a class="reference external" href="target_editor.html">Target
file</a> containing these desired values is
required for any optimization or synthesis procedure in
OptiLayer.  The Target database in OptiLayer stores these target
files and can be accessed using the Target command in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_data.html">Data
menu</a>. A target file can contain a set of
values for a group of one or more characteristics such as
reflectance, transmittance, absorptance, and phase properties of a
coating for one or more polarization states (if applicable) and one
or more angles of incidence. Having a target file allows OptiLayer to
optimize coating designs to meet specific optical requirements,
ensuring that the resulting coatings exhibit desired optical
properties within the specified spectral band. By providing the
target values, users can guide the optimization process towards
achieving the desired performance of the coatings.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="integral-target-files">Integral Target files</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, another type of target function is the <a class="reference external" href="integral_target.html">Integral
Target</a>. The Integral Target describes
requirements for integral values of spectral characteristics. This
type of target function is particularly useful for applications such
as solar cells, where integral properties of the optical response are
crucial. Additionally, color requirements can also be expressed as
Integral Targets in OptiLayer. The Integral Targets in OptiLayer are
implemented as a specific database dedicated to storing and managing
these types of target functions. By using Integral Targets, users can
specify constraints and requirements on the overall performance of
the coating, particularly focusing on integral values of spectral
characteristics rather than point-by-point optimization. For
applications where the overall integrated performance of the coating
is more important than specific spectral features at individual
wavelengths, the use of Integral Targets provides a valuable tool for
optimizing coatings to meet these broader requirements. The specific
database for Integral Targets in OptiLayer streamlines the process of
defining and applying these constraints in the optimization and
synthesis procedures.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="color-target-files">Color Target files</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, another type of target function is the <a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_color_target.html">Color
Target</a>.The Color Target describes
the spectral composition of transmitted or reflected light by
specifying its color coordinates. This target can be defined for
different angles of incidence as well as different polarizations of
light, allowing for precise control over the color properties of the
coating. Spectral (angular) targets and color targets in OptiLayer
are specified using convenient spreadsheet formats, making it easy
for users to input and manage the desired color requirements for
their coatings. Spectral (angular) targets can be entered at multiple
separate data pages, allowing users to specify targets for different
angles of incidence or polarization states independently. This
flexibility in defining targets in separate data pages is incredibly
convenient, as it enables users to incorporate a wide range of target
data into the design procedure simultaneously. Users can input and
manipulate different target values for various spectral
characteristics, angles of incidence, or polarization states,
tailoring the optimization process to meet specific design
requirements and achieve the desired optical properties of the
coating.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="light-source-and-detector-files">Light Source and Detector files</p>
<p>To accurately assess how the human eye perceives the color of
reflected or transmitted light from a coated surface, it is important
to consider the spectral energy distribution of the incident light.
In OptiLayer, the <a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_light_source.html">Light Source and
Detectors</a> commands open the
LightSource/Detectors database. Light source files within this
database are used to specify the energy distribution of the light
spectrum that illuminates the coating being analyzed. By default,
OptiLayer assumes a uniform distribution spectrum for the light
source when analyzing a coating, meaning that there is equal energy
at all wavelengths. However, in reality, light sources do not have
uniform spectra; each source has a unique characteristic spectrum
associated with it. To account for this, OptiLayer provides
additional light source files with varying spectral distributions to
aid in color calculations. These files can be transferred into any
Problem database from the Catalog database that comes with OptiLayer.
Note that files in the Catalog database can only be accessed using
the FileTransfer command. Furthermore, users have the option to
create custom Light Source and Detectors files and store them in the
LightSource/Detectors database. This flexibility allows users to
accurately model the spectral characteristics of the incident light
and customize the analysis to match real-world lighting conditions,
resulting in more accurate predictions of color perception for
coatings.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="cone-angle-files">Cone Angle files</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, the Cone Angle database stores parameters that describe
the cone angle averaging procedure used in computations involving
parameters like Reflectance (Ra), Transmittance (Ta), and
Bidirectional Reflectance (BRa). When a <a class="reference external" href="coneangledatabase.html">Cone
Angle</a> file is loaded into memory, all
computations related to these parameters are performed using the cone
averaging procedure specified in the file. If you wish to disable the
cone angle averaging and revert to standard calculations without cone
angle correction, you can simply unload the Cone Angle file from
memory using the “Remove Cone Angle” menu command. By removing the
Cone Angle file, you can ensure that subsequent calculations for
parameters like Ra, Ta, and BRa are performed without cone angle
averaging, providing results based on standard assumptions and
calculations.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="materials-files">Materials Files</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, the Layer Materials command opens the <a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_layer_material.html">Layer
Materials database</a>, where users
can define the optical properties of various materials used in the
design of coatings. Layer materials are referenced with single-letter
abbreviations within the design. These materials can be
non-dispersive, characterized by a single refractive index value, or
dispersive, characterized by real and imaginary parts of the
refractive index at different wavelengths.
To specify the optical properties of substrates, incident media, and
layer materials, users can utilize spreadsheet formats for dispersive
data or define refractive index formulas. OptiLayer provides a
variety of formulas for defining dispersive optical properties,
including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ul>
<li></li>
<li><p>Several Sellmeier formulas,</p></li>
<li><p>Cauchy formulas,</p></li>
<li><p>Hartmann and Hartmann-2 formulas,</p></li>
<li><p>Schott Glass formula,</p></li>
<li><p>Drude formula,</p></li>
<li><p>Spline interpolation.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these formulas, users can accurately model the
wavelength-dependent refractive indices of dispersive materials,
allowing for more detailed and precise analysis of coatings with
varying optical properties across different wavelengths.
Additionally, these formulas provide flexibility and customization
options for designing coatings with specific optical characteristics.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="substrate">Substrate</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, the Substrate command opens the <a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_layer_material.html">Substrate
database</a>, where users can define the
optical properties of substrate materials used in coating designs.
Substrate materials are specified in the same manner as layer
materials, with single-letter abbreviations within the design. Files
from the Substrate database can be loaded not only as substrates but
also as Incident Medium and Exit Medium files. To load substrate
files for these purposes, users can utilize the right-click popup
menu of the <a class="reference external" href="idh_modify_database.html">Database window</a>. This
allows for easy access to substrate data and seamless integration
into the design process for specifying substrates, incident media,
and exit media with defined optical properties from the Substrate
database.</p>
<p class="p-heading4indent rubric" id="design-files">Design Files</p>
<p>In OptiLayer, <a class="reference external" href="idh_design.html">Design Files</a> are used to
describe the structure of coatings. Users can access the database
archive of design files by using the Design command in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_data.html">Data
menu</a>. A design file specifies the number of
layers in a coating, their thicknesses, the materials they are made
of, and the order of the layers. During the optimization and
synthesis processes, the number of layers and layer parameters may be
adjusted to meet design requirements.</p>
<p>Designs can be specified using a spreadsheet format, allowing for the
synchronous presentation of layer thickness in various units such as
Physical thickness, Optical thickness, QWOT, and FWOT (full
wavelength optical thickness). Alternatively, designs can be
specified using a standard formula presentation, providing
flexibility in defining the structure of coatings. Each design can
have up to 65535 layers, allowing for complex multilayer coatings to
be accurately represented and optimized within OptiLayer’s design
environment. This capability enables users to create detailed and
customized coating designs to meet specific optical performance
requirements.</p>
