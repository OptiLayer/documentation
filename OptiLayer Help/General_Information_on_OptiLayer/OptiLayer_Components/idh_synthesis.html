<p>The refinement and synthesis procedures in OptiLayer are aimed at
designing optical coatings with specific spectral (angular)
characteristics by optimizing a merit function through the variation
of construction parameters such as the number of layers, materials
used, and their thicknesses. OptiLayer offers several refinement
modes that utilize powerful optimization routines to achieve the
desired coating design. Some of the optimization routines used in
OptiLayer include:</p>
<div class="docutils container">
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li></li>
</ol>
</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Modified Dumped Least Squares: This optimization method is used
to minimize the sum of squares of the differences between the
observed and predicted values, with modifications to enhance
convergence and stability.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Sequential Quadratic Programming: This optimization technique
involves solving a sequence of quadratic subproblems to
iteratively improve the solution and converge towards the
optimal design.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Newton Method: The Newton method is an iterative optimization
algorithm that uses second-order derivatives to find the
minimum of a function. It converges quickly and efficiently to
a local minimum.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-normal docutils container">
<p>Hyper Newton Method: The Hyper Newton method is an extension of
the Newton method that incorporates additional information or
constraints to improve convergence and stability in complex
optimization problems.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By utilizing these advanced optimization routines, OptiLayer allows
users to efficiently optimize the design of optical coatings by
varying construction parameters and exploring different design
possibilities to achieve the desired spectral and angular
characteristics. These optimization modes help users achieve optimal
coating designs that meet specific performance requirements and
maximize overall coating performance.</p>
<p>OptiLayer stands out as a unique thin film software due to its
sophisticated analytic algorithms developed by its creators, which
offer exceptional convergence rates and accuracy in its optimization
routines. All optimization routines in OptiLayer are based on this
proprietary know-how, ensuring superior performance in refining and
synthesizing optical coatings with desired characteristics.
One of the most powerful design techniques available in OptiLayer is
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_needle_optimization.html">Needle Optimization</a>, which
can be used in both manual and automatic modes:
In the manual mode, advanced users have the ability to control the
needle optimization procedure by selecting insertion points for new
layers, performing multiple variations with the needle, and
fine-tuning the design process.
The automatic mode allows for the needle optimization procedure to
run automatically, streamlining the design process. This mode also
offers setup options that increase flexibility, such as multiple
needle insertions, to further enhance the optimization process.
Both manual and automatic modes of the Needle Optimization technique
in OptiLayer automatically select optimal layer materials when
multiple materials are specified for the coating design, simplifying
the design process and ensuring that the best materials are chosen
for the desired optical characteristics.
Overall, OptiLayer’s unique optimization algorithms and the
implementation of the Needle Optimization technique in both manual
and automatic modes make it a powerful tool for designing optical
coatings with high precision, efficiency, and flexibility in
achieving the desired spectral and angular characteristics.</p>

<td><p>Note: The exceptional power of the genuine Needle
Optimization technique implemented in OptiLayer stems
from the unparalleled mathematical expertise developed
by the creators of OptiLayer, who have been refining
this technique since its inception in 1982 by Professor
A.V. Tikhonravov. This extensive experience and
knowledge have allowed OptiLayer to leverage the full
potential of the Needle Optimization technique, making
it a cutting-edge tool for optimizing and designing thin
film coatings with exceptional accuracy and efficiency.</p></td>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="idh_gradual_evolution.html">Gradual Evolution</a> mode in
OptiLayer expands the capabilities of the Needle Optimization
technique by focusing on finding designs that are highly
manufacturable. This mode allows for the generation of a range of
designs with varying combinations of key parameters such as merit
function value, number of design layers, and total design thickness,
enabling users to explore and select designs that meet specific
manufacturing criteria.
In addition to the Needle Optimization technique, OptiLayer offers
other non-local design techniques such as <a class="reference external" href="inhomogeneous_refinement.html">Inhomogeneous
Refinement</a> and <a class="reference external" href="idh_random_optimization.html">Random
Optimization</a>.</p>
<p>These techniques are particularly valuable for addressing specialized
modern design challenges, such as the design of gain flattening
filters, and provide additional flexibility and tools to tackle
diverse design problems effectively.
For designing <a class="reference external" href="wdm_filter_design___material_s.html">WDM filters</a>,
OptiLayer has developed an extremely efficient automatic design
technique tailored specifically to meet the requirements of WDM
applications. Like other design options within OptiLayer, the WDM
design option leverages proprietary know-how that sets it apart from
other thin film software programs, ensuring high-quality results and
performance in WDM filter design tasks.</p>
<p>OptiLayer allows users to specify design targets in both Spectral and
Angular modes, with the Angular mode being particularly useful when
design targets are defined across an angular range.</p>
<p><strong>OptiLayer</strong> constructs a merit function automatically in the
correspondence with user-specified targets (target values, tolerances
and qualifiers). The following formula represents one of the
OptiLayer merit function (MF):</p>
<p>        <img alt="image4" src="../../_images/eqn002.gif" /></p>
<p>Here N is the total number of targets, Tj’  are target values, DTj
 are tolerances, and Tj are theoretical values of the spectral
characteristics calculated for the design loaded in memory.</p>
<p>Targets include:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>Reflectance, Back Reflectance, Transmittance, Absorptance for
s-, p-, and average polarizations.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>Phase shifts on reflection and transmission for s- and p-
polarizations.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>Differential phase shifts on reflection and transmission.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>Group delay and Group delay dispersion for the reflected and
transmitted light of s- and p- polarizations.</p>
</div>

<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>User-defined targets</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="p-indentlist2 docutils container">
<p>Combinations of various targets listed above</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In OptiLayer’s Spectral mode, users have the flexibility to consider
targets at a high resolution of up to 8192 spectral points across
multiple target pages, with the ability to have up to 99 target
pages. This extensive range of spectral points and target pages
enables users to explore and optimize complex combinations of various
targets for thin film coatings across different spectral ranges.
Moreover, within each target page, users can specify targets that
correspond to different incidence angles, allowing for the design of
coatings tailored to wide spectral and angular range applications.
This feature enhances the versatility of OptiLayer in addressing
diverse design requirements and optimizing coatings for a broad range
of spectral and angular conditions, ensuring that the resulting
designs meet specific performance criteria across different
operational scenarios.</p>
