<p>The paste buffer contains data imported using the menu command
<strong>Import (F9</strong>) (refer to <a class="reference external" href="idh_import.htm">Text Data Import</a>
for more details). This buffer is displayed when transferring the
imported data to the current spreadsheet. You can choose to enter
either a single value into the current cell or an entire column of
data.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/paste_bu.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Transform</strong> button enables you to apply a <a class="reference external" href="trasform_function.htm">Transform
function</a> that allows for simple
modifications to the data in the Paste Buffer before executing the
paste operation. These preliminary transformations can be quite
beneficial in preparing the data for insertion.</p>
<p>The transfer of data from the <strong>Paste Buffer</strong> to the source file
always begins with the data value highlighted in the data column
of the Paste Buffer. There are several options available for
transferring data from the Paste Buffer to the source file.</p>
<p>To transfer all values that follow the highlighted value, simply
press the <strong>Column</strong> button in the <strong>Paste Buffer</strong>. If you attempt to
transfer (or paste) more data values than there are rows in the
target data file, only the values necessary to fill the
available rows in the target file will be transferred.
Consequently, you may notice that in such a situation, the data
column in the Paste Buffer is not marked as &lt;EMPTY&gt; after the
paste operation is completed. This indicates that some values
remained in the Paste Buffer since they could not be
accommodated in the target file.</p>
<p>To transfer values from the Paste Buffer to a selected group of
rows in the target file, first mark the desired rows in the
target file using the <strong>F7</strong> key. After selecting the rows, you can
proceed to transfer the data by pressing the <strong>Column</strong> button in
the Paste Buffer. This action will paste the values from the
Paste Buffer into only the marked rows in the target file,
ensuring that your data is applied precisely where you need it.</p>
<p>A single value from the Paste Buffer can be transferred to a
single row in a specific column of the target file by pressing
the <strong>“Current”</strong> button in the Paste Buffer window. The cell in the
target file where the value from the Paste Buffer is to be
transferred must be selected with the mouse before the paste
operation is executed.</p>
<p>Note that the destination rows and columns of the target file
are indicated in the respective information fields in the Paste
Buffer window.</p>
<p>If no spreadsheet is open for editing, the <strong>“Column”</strong> and <strong>“Current”</strong>
buttons will be disabled.</p>
