<h1>Column Editor</h1>
<p>The Column Editor is one of OptiChar’s specialized
<a class="reference external" href="idh_spreadsheet_editing.html">Spreadsheet Editing Tools</a>,
designed for fast and convenient modifications of spreadsheet
columns. It is particularly useful for entering an entire column
of constants or a series of uniformly increasing or decreasing
values.</p>
<p>If no specific rows in the column are selected (marked using the
<strong>F7 key</strong>, which highlights the selected entries), the editor will
apply its changes to the entire column. Conversely, if a
specific set of rows is selected, the Column Editor will only
modify the highlighted portion of the column.</p>
<p>The Column Editor can be accessed from any location where
spreadsheet editing is required. You can activate it through the
OptiChar <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_edit.html">Edit menu</a>, the toolbar, or
by pressing the <strong>F6</strong> key. Additionally, certain modal dialogs
include special buttons that provide direct access to the Column
Editor.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/col_ed.png" /></p>
<p>Upon launching the <strong>Column Editor</strong>, the title bar indicates which
spreadsheet column you are currently editing. You have the
option to select specific rows within that column by setting
values in the <strong>Editing Rows</strong> fields. By default, the entire column
is selected for editing. However, if you have previously
selected certain rows in the spreadsheet, the C**olumn Editor** will
automatically display only those selected rows for editing when
it opens.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Apply to</strong> box, you can choose one of the available modes:
<strong>All</strong>, <strong>Odd</strong>, or <strong>Even</strong>. This feature allows you to modify the values
in a more targeted way, based on your specific needs.</p>
<p>To fill a column with identical values, simply type the desired
value in the <strong>Starting value</strong> edit box, and ensure the <strong>Increment</strong>
box is set to zero. This will result in every cell in the column
being filled with that same value. If you wish to create an
increasing sequence of values, enter a positive number in the
Increment box. Conversely, to generate a decreasing sequence,
you can input a negative number as the increment. This
functionality allows for versatile data entry, whether you need
uniform values or a range of sequential numbers.</p>
<p>Additional functionality is offered by the Column Editor through
the <strong>Percentage tab.</strong> This tab enables users to adjust selected
values by a percentage of the current values instead of using an
absolute value.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/col_ed2.png" /></p>
<p>In this mode, it is possible to apply relative corrections
(measured in percent) to the values of the selected column.
Negative values are also permitted, allowing for a decrease in
values as well.</p>
<p>Another convenient operation is available through the <strong>Transform
tab</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/col_ed3.png" /></p>
<p>In this mode, it is possible to specify a linear transformation
relation as follows:</p>
<p>V<sub>new</sub> = a· V<sub>old</sub> + b</p>
<p>where V<sub>new</sub> and V<sub>old</sub> represent the new and old values of the
selected column cells, respectively, and a and b are the
coefficients of the linear transformation. Additionally, it is
possible to reverse the order of values.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Note: It is possible to specify a range of rows that exceeds
the current number of rows available in the spreadsheet. When
this occurs, the spreadsheet will automatically expand to
accommodate the specified range.</p>
