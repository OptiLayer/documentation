<h1>Window Menu</h1>
<p>This menu shows all currently opened windows in <strong>OptiChar</strong>. You can
easily activate any window by selecting it from the list, allowing
for quick navigation between different tasks and ensuring that you
can focus on the work you need to do seamlessly.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/window_menu_oc.png" /></p>
<p>Using this menu is equivalent to the <a class="reference external" href="idh_window_list.html">Window Listâ€¦</a> command.</p>
<p><strong>Switch menu</strong> item opens a submenu that lists all instances of
OptiChar currently in memory. By selecting a different item, you
can easily switch control to another instance.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Tile Windows</strong> command begins the automated repositioning of
windows. This repositioning is handled by an algorithm that
attempts to arrange the windows in a tiled style. If you have a
multi-monitor setup, the primary monitor is considered first,
followed by all other monitors.</p>
<p>Use <strong>All Monitors</strong> command enables the Tile command and user
interface commands to open windows across additional monitors.
However, some users may prefer that the software opens new
windows only on the primary monitor. In that case, simply
uncheck this option.</p>
