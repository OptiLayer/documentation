provides a search for the film inhomogeneity near the substrate
boundary. This inhomogeneity is modeled by a parabolic deviation
of the inhomogeneity factor from 1 in a small vicinity of the
substrate boundary.</div>
<div class="line">- If the checkbox Near Ambient is checked, the program provides
a search for the film surface inhomogeneity near the ambient
boundary in the following way: It is assumed that there is a
thin overlayer with a refractive index independent of its
thickness. This overlayer consists of the same material as the
film but has 50% porosity. The refractive index of the overlayer
is calculated using the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory.
The only unknown parameter is the total thickness of the
overlayer.</div>
<div class="line">Note: It may be difficult to estimate the results of the near
ambient characterization using the plot of the inhomogeneity
factor (if the thickness of the overlayer is small). The user
can find the thickness of the overlayer in the Layer Report in
the View submenu.</div>
