<h1>Surface Inhomogeneity</h1>
<p>This option provides a search for surface inhomogeneities in
thin films.</p>
<p>It is possible to search for inhomogeneity Near Ambient Medium
and Near Substrate independently. This functionality allows for
a detailed analysis of the thin film characteristics, enhancing
the accuracy of material evaluations and quality control
processes.</p>
<p>The Surface Inhomogeneity Setup window has two checkboxes:</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/csurfinh.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the checkbox Near Substrate is checked, the program</p></li>
</ul>
<p>provides a search for the film inhomogeneity near the substrate
boundary. This inhomogeneity is modeled by a parabolic deviation
of the inhomogeneity factor from 1 in a small vicinity of the
substrate boundary.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the checkbox Near Ambient is checked, the program provides</p></li>
</ul>
<p>a search for the film surface inhomogeneity near the ambient
boundary in the following way: It is assumed that there is a
thin overlayer with a refractive index independent of its
thickness. This overlayer consists of the same material as the
film but has 50% porosity. The refractive index of the overlayer
is calculated using the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory.
The only unknown parameter is the total thickness of the
overlayer.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note:</strong> It may be difficult to estimate the results of the near
ambient characterization using the plot of the inhomogeneity
factor (if the thickness of the overlayer is small). The user
can find the thickness of the overlayer in the Layer Report in
the View submenu.</p>
