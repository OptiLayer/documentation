<h1>Layer Refinement</h1>
<p>The <strong>Refinement Setup</strong> window shares similarities with the <a class="reference external" href="idh_layer_characterization.html">Layer Characterization Setup</a>
window. The default thickness limits are defined as ranging from
h/1.4 to 4h , where h represents the thickness stored in computer
memory. The lower and upper limits for both the refractive index
and the extinction coefficient are established based on the
settings in the <a class="reference external" href="idh_layer_characterization.html">Layer Characterization Setup</a> window. However, users
have the flexibility to reset these limits as needed.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/crefinement.png" /></p>
<p>The lower section of the Refinement Setup window offers a
selection of models for the layer refractive index and extinction
coefficient. Users can choose the desired model by selecting the
corresponding field. The name of each model, such as
non-dispersive or normal dispersion, reflects the physical
significance of the model.</p>
<p>The models <strong>n(λ)</strong> and <strong>k(λ)</strong> represent an arbitrary but smooth
dependence of the refractive index and extinction coefficient on
wavelength. These models encompass many parameters and are most
suitable for complex cases where other models may not be
sufficient.</p>
<p>When either the <strong>n(λ)</strong> or <strong>k(λ)</strong> model is selected, the corresponding
slider on the right side of the dialog can be utilized to control
the smoothness of the associated function.</p>

<p>The top positions of the sliders correspond to very smooth
functions. As you move the sliders down, you can attain
increasingly complex functions with many fine features. It is
crucial to exercise caution when decreasing the smoothness, as
the inverse problem may become unstable at certain points,
resulting in solutions that lack physical meaning. Always verify
the obtained results against a priori information and common
sense.</p>
<p>In addition, simple inhomogeneity models can also be utilized.
These include the first-order <strong>Schröder</strong> inhomogeneity and a
<strong>surface overlayer</strong> near the ambient medium.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to specify <strong>Measurement Correction</strong> if
there is evidence of potential drift or scale issues in the
measurement data being processed. With this choice, the
measurement data points will be adjusted during the Layer
Characterization procedure to minimize the value of the
discrepancy.</p>
<p>The layer refinement mode aims to minimize the discrepancy
between theoretical and experimental data, starting from the
result currently stored in computer memory. This mode is
particularly useful for defining the optical parameters of a
layer within the framework of a new layer model or new parameter
limits.</p>
