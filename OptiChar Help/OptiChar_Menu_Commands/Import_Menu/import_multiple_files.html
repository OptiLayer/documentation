<h1>Import Multiple Files</h1>
<p>The Import Multiple Files option greatly simplifies the
measurement data import process. Using this option, you can
import many files in one simple operation. The file format is
recognized automatically by OptiChar.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/multi_files_1.png" /></p>
<p>The Import Multiple Files command opens the corresponding window.
At the top of the window, the currently opened folder is
displayed, which can be changed using the <strong>Browse</strong> Â button on the
right side. The <strong>Reload</strong> button initiates the reloading of all files
in the current folder. This feature is useful if new files have
been added or if some files have been deleted from this folder by
another program.</p>
<p>Instead of using the <strong>Browse</strong> button, it is possible to use a
<strong>drag-and-drop</strong> operation. Simply select the files of interest or
a folder containing these files and drop them onto the right
part of the window.</p>

<div><p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the Measurement database as a drop
target for files to be imported! In this case, you even do not
need to open the Import Multiple Files dialog yourself.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After selecting a data folder with measurement files, they are
scanned by OptiChar, and related data for the selected file is
shown in the chart.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/multi_files_2.png" /></p>
<p>You can view extracted spectra. It is possible to select only a
part of the files for the import.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Important note:</strong> You need to adjust import options correctly.
See, for example, how to import <a class="reference external" href="importxydata_meas.html">X, Y
data</a> files. If files of different
types are present in the same folder, the corresponding import
options should be checked and adjusted for each of the types
separately. Since a chance to make an error in this case is high
enough, we recommend using import of multiple files for the
files of a single type.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Import</strong> button will perform the actual import operations, and
all selected files will be saved to the <a class="reference external" href="target_editor.html">Measurements
database</a>.</p>
