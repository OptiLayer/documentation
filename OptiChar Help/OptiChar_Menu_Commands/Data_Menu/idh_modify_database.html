<p>OptiChar provides a unified database access window for accessing
all data files in a similar manner. This window allows you to
select from four types of data: <strong>Measurements</strong>, <strong>Substrate</strong>, <strong>Layer
Material</strong>, and <strong>Layer Models</strong>. Regardless of the type of data you
initially open the window with, you can easily switch to other
types by selecting the appropriate tab at the bottom of the
window.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can perform an incremental search for a file
in the database by simply typing the first few letters of the
file name.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../_images/db_oc.png" /></p>
<p>In version 14.57, we introduced the instant preview function,
which allows any database file to be visualized in a small Preview
window. This feature significantly simplifies the process of
working with large databases.</p>
<p>The <strong>Preview</strong> sub-window can be detached from the main database
window and positioned anywhere on the screen, providing
flexibility in your workspace. It can also be docked to any side
of the database window. To do this, simply use a drag-and-drop
operation on the caption of the Preview window.</p>
<p>Actions on database files are accessible through the menu bar at
the top of the window. The menu items allow you to perform
various operations, including loading a file, editing an
existing file, creating a new file, making a copy of a file,
renaming a file, deleting a file, generating a text output of
file contents, and sorting the files in the database in multiple
ways.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/db_oc1.png" /></p>
<p>The commands for <strong>Load</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Rename</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>, and <strong>Output</strong>
can be applied to a selected file. You can select a file by
clicking on it or by navigating through the list using the arrow
keys.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Load:</strong> This command loads a selected file from the disk into
the computer’s memory. See <a class="reference external" href="idh_loading_data.html">Loading Data
Files</a>. In some situations
(for example, Measurement data), the same file can be used in
different ways.</p>
<p>Note the <strong>small arrow</strong> to the right of the <strong>Load</strong> button; it
invokes a special popup menu providing access to additional
options. These options are also accessible through the
right-click menu of the Database window.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Edit:</strong> This command can be used to modify a selected file.
For more details, refer to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="target_editor.html">Editing Measurements</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="idh_edit_layer_material.html">Editing Substrate and Layer Material</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="layer_model_editor.html">Editing Layer Model</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Editing a file in a database does not affect the contents
of the file currently residing in memory; it only affects
the contents of the file stored on the disk. To change the
memory contents, use the <strong>Load</strong> command.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> Measurement data and Layer Models can be edited in memory
using the <strong>Modify Measurements</strong> and <strong>Modify Model</strong> commands in
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_characterization_menu.html">Characterization
menu</a> .</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New:</strong> This menu item allows you to create a new file. When
selected, you will be prompted for a new filename and an
optional comment (see <a class="reference external" href="idh_database_new_file.html">Creating a New Database
**File**</a>). You will then
automatically enter <strong>Edit</strong> mode to modify the contents of the
new file. Some data fields are already filled with default
values, which should be changed to suit your needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Warning:</strong> The maximum number of files in each database is 799.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Copy:</strong> This command allows you to copy a file. This is useful
if it is appropriate to modify an existing file for a new
purpose. After selecting this command, you will be asked to
confirm the copy process or cancel it. Upon confirmation, you
will be prompted to enter a new filename and comments, in the
same way as for the <strong>New</strong> command.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Warning:</strong> The maximum number of files in each database is 799.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rename:</strong> This command allows you to rename a selected file.
When selected, a dialog box titled “Rename To” will open,
with the name of the selected file highlighted. A second
field for the comment associated with the file is also
displayed. After changing either of these fields and clicking
the <strong>OK</strong> button, the database will be updated to reflect the
new name and/or comment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete:</strong> This command allows you to delete any file in a
database. You will be prompted to confirm whether you really
want to delete the selected file. Upon confirming the
deletion, the file will be removed from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting a file destroys its contents; once
deleted, it cannot be recovered.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Output:</strong> The output option allows the creation of a text report
on the contents of a selected file (see <a class="reference external" href="idh_output.html">Creating
Text Output</a>). You can save this
report as an ASCII file (using the <strong>Save Output As</strong> command) or
send it directly to the printer (using the <strong>Print</strong> command) from
the <a class="reference external" href="idh_menu_file.html">File Menu</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sort:</strong> This command allows you to sort the filenames in a
database in different ways. Files can be sorted by the
alphabetical order of their names, the names of their
creators, or by creation or revision dates. Any sorted
category can also be arranged in reverse order. For details,
see <a class="reference external" href="idh_config_sorting.html">Setting Sorting
Options</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Find:</strong> This opens an additional search tool. You can specify
a name pattern in order to search for the required file in
large databases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quit:</strong> This command closes the database window.</p></li>
