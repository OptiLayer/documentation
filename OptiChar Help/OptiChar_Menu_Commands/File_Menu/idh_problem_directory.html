<p>OptiChar is structured around discrete database directories,
enabling users to store all data related to specific problems in
uniquely identified directories on their hard disk. These
directories are referred to as <strong>Problem Directories</strong>.
Each Problem Directory contains databases for measurement data,
substrates, layer materials, and layer models. The extensive
entry and editing options in OptiChar allow users to easily
create and modify data files.</p>
<p>OptiChar supports separate configurations and environments for
each Problem Directory. It saves the configuration and
environment status upon closing the directory after you finish
working with it. When you reopen the same directory, both the
configuration and environment are automatically restored to
their last saved state.
Additionally, Problem Directories are compatible with all other
programs in the OptiLayer family, allowing for the seamless use
of common files across all OptiLayer applications.</p>

<p>The <strong>Problem List Box</strong> in this window displays the existing
Problem Directories.</p>
<p>To select a different directory, simply choose it from the list
and press the <strong>OK</strong> button. You may be prompted to save your
current data before switching to a new directory.</p>
<p>To create a new directory, enter its name in the input field at
the top of the window and press the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p>The Comment field at the bottom of the Problem Directory dialog
allows you to store detailed descriptions for each Problem
Directory. There is no character limit for the text in the
Comment field.</p>

<div><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> The Problem Directory dialog can be resized if necessary. To
resize the dialog, use the special grip located at the bottom
right corner.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../../_images/arrow_r.png" /> The OptiLayer software family employs the concept of an
OptiLayer Root Directory, which is a designated location for
storing a set of problem directories. Users may select any
directory, except for root directories on the disk, as their
OptiLayer Root Directory. This selection can be made using the
drop-down list at the bottom of the Problem Directory window.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> button activates the Find panel, which assists in
searching for a folder by its specified name.</p>
<p>The <strong>Clone…</strong> button opens an additional dialog for creating a
<a class="reference external" href="Problem_Directory/new_problem_directory.html">New Problem Directory</a>. This
function enables users to create a copy of the currently selected
Problem Directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rename…</strong> button enables users to rename the selected Problem
Directory. A small dialog will appear below, prompting the user to
specify the new name.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/probdirrename.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Delete</strong> operation allows you to delete the currently selected
Problem directory. Please note that this operation is irreversible
and should be confirmed before proceeding. Ensure that you truly
wish to delete this directory, as recovery will not be possible.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../../_images/delete_dir.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Browse</strong> dialog for selecting a new Root Directory is shown
below:</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../../_images/probbrowse.png" /></p>
<p>To choose a new OptiLayer Root Directory, press the <strong>Browse…</strong>
button. This action will invoke the <strong>Select Directory</strong> dialog box,
allowing you to navigate and select your desired directory.</p>
