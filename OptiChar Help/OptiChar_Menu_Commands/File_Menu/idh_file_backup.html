<h1>Problem directory backup</h1>
<p>Storing problem directory data can be quite handy for future use,
transferring to another computer, or backing up to external media
such as a floppy disk. OptiChar provides a feature that allows you
to create an archived backup copy of any problem directory. Once
you’ve created this archive, it can be used to restore your saved
data whenever necessary. This ensures that your work is secure and
accessible, protecting against data loss or facilitating easy data
transfer.</p>

<p>You can back up one problem directory at a time. To perform a
backup, select a problem directory from the list labeled
<strong>“OptiLayer Problem Directories.”</strong> If needed, you can choose the
<strong>OptiLayer Root Directory</strong> by pressing the <strong>Browse</strong> button or by
selecting the name of a root directory from the combo box at the
bottom of the list.</p>
<p>In the list box <strong>Backup</strong> on the right side of the dialog window,
select the destination disk drive and (if necessary) the directory
where a backup file will be created. OptiChar will generate a
backup file with the name of the directory you are saving,
followed by the “.zip” extension.</p>
<p>To complete the backup, press the <strong>Backup</strong> button. In the fields
labeled <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong>, located just below the button, you can see
the names of the source directory and the destination file.</p>
<p>To restore data that has been previously saved, select the
appropriate drive and (if necessary) the directory in the <strong>Backup</strong>
frame. In the list of files at the bottom of the frame, all
archive (“.zip”) files are listed. Select the file you need to
restore.</p>
<p>OptiChar creates or overwrites a problem directory with the same
name as that of the backup file.</p>
<p>To restore a saved problem directory, press the button <strong>Restore</strong>.
In the fields <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> right below the button you can see the
names of the source backup file and destination problem
directory.</p>
<p>The radio button <strong>To Process</strong> allows you to include or exclude
files other than OptiChar data files (for example, any
documentation files that you may have in your problem
directory). If you want to back up only OptiChar data files,
select the <strong>Only Data Files</strong> option. Otherwise, select <strong>All Files</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Convert: to ver. 8.18</strong> format option allows you to convert all
data files to a format compatible with version 8.18 of OptiLayer
Thin Film Software. Please note that settings related to new
features not available in version 8.18 will be lost during this
conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Use Password</strong> to encrypt ZIP files created with the Backup
operation. Specify the password in the related entry field.</p>
