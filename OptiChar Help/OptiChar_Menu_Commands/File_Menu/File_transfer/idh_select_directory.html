<h1>Select Directory or Project</h1>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="idh_file_transfer.html">File Transfer</a> feature allows the
exchange of data between different problem directories, which is
particularly useful since the same data files may often be
utilized in various locations. To initiate the File Transfer,
you first need to specify a source directory from which the data
will be pulled. This facilitates the management and integration
of data across multiple projects more efficiently.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../../../_images/sel_dir.png" /></p>
<p>The list box in this window shows the existing problem
directories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Find</strong> button is activated to allow you to utilize the Find
feature, simplifying your search using some pattern.</p>
<p>To choose another directory, select it in the list and press the
<strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p>When using the OptiLayer software, you can select an alternative
OptiLayer Root Directory to facilitate the <strong>File Transfer</strong>
process. To do this, you can either choose a different directory
from the corresponding combo box or initiate the Browse dialog
by clicking the <strong>Browseâ€¦</strong> button.</p>
<p>Additionally, a helpful <strong>Comment</strong> will typically be displayed
below the selection area, which serves as guidance to assist you
in identifying the correct directory for the file transfer. This
ensures that you can locate the appropriate files without
confusion and proceed with your data exchange more effectively.</p>
