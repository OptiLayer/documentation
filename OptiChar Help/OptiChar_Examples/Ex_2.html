<h1><strong>LEC24C2 – Verification of characterization results – Ta2O5 film is used as an example</strong></h1>
<blockquote>

characterization theory, we recommend the book by A. Tikhonravov,

<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate an approach to verify
the wavelength dependence of the refractive index determined during thin
film characterization. Ta2O5 film deposited on a Suprasil substrate
using the IBS process is used as an example.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C2</strong>. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the <strong>SUPRACIL</strong> substrate and the
measurement datafile <strong>Ta2O5 – T data</strong>. Open the <strong>Data Fitting</strong>
option in the <strong>View</strong> menu. The dense set of dots in this window shows
measured transmittance data, and the solid curve represents the
reflectance from the uncoated <strong>SUPRACIL</strong> substrate. Substrate
thickness is specified in the line <strong>Substrate thickness</strong> of the
<strong>General Information</strong> window.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex_2-1.png" /></p>
<p>As with the LEC24C1 example, there are useful theoretical facts that are
important for choosing a layer model for characterization using spectral
transmittance data.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If the film is non-absorbing, has no bulk inhomogeneity across the
film thickness, and its refractive index is higher than the
refractive index of the substrate, then the measured transmittance
maxima should coincide with the transmittance of the uncoated
substrate.</p></li>
<li><p>If the film has bulk inhomogeneity, then the transmittance maxima
will be shifted relative to the transmittance of the uncoated
substrate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window we see that the transmittance maxima are
shifted downwards relative to the transmittance of the uncoated
substrate. In principle, the downward shift of T spectral data can be
related to absorption in the film. However, it is well known that Ta2O5
films do not absorb in the spectral range under consideration. Thus, the
observed shift should be attributed to the film inhomogeneity.</p>
<p>As usual, we start our investigation using the <strong>Layer
Characterization</strong> menu option and choosing a model of a homogeneous
thin film. Let’s choose the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong> (three-parameter
Cauchy model) for the refractive index and <strong>Non-absorbing</strong> model in
the <strong>Extinction</strong> field.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex_2-2.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the characterization procedure. The results are
displayed in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> and <strong>Layer Plots</strong> windows. The
<strong>Data Fitting</strong> window shows the deviations in the model transmittance
(solid curve) from the measured data which were expected. The refractive
index of the Ta2O5 film found in the frame of the homogeneous model is
stored in the <strong>Layer material</strong> database under the name <strong>Ta2O5 –
homogeneous model</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/ex_2-3.png" /> <img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex_2-4.png" /></p>
<p>Let us move on to the <strong>Layer Refinement</strong> option of the
<strong>Characterization</strong> menu and check the <strong>Bulk</strong> checkbox in the lower
left part of the window. The bulk inhomogeneity will be searched for
within the framework of the Schroeder’s model assuming a liner change in
the refractive index of the film from its back boundary to the front
boundary.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_2-5.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the refinement procedure. The results displayed in
the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window show a better match to the measured data
than before. The refractive index of the Ta2O5 film found in the frame
of the inhomogeneous model is stored in the <strong>Layer material</strong> database
under the name <strong>Ta2O5 – inhomogeneous model</strong>. The degree of
inhomogeneity is positive, which means that the refractive index
increases from the back boundary of the film to the front boundary.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_2-6.png" /></p>
<p>First of all, let us compare the refractive indices found within the
homogeneous and inhomogeneous film models. To do this, go to the
<strong>Compare Index Plots</strong> option in the <strong>View</strong> menu. Select the <strong>Ta2O5
– homogeneous model</strong> and <strong>Ta2O5 – inhomogeneous model</strong> files and
click the <strong>Compare</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img alt="image6a" src="../_images/ex_2-6a.png" /></p>
<p>The difference in the found refractive index
values is not very significant, it is about 0.2-0.3 %. However, the
refractive index wavelength dependence found within the inhomogeneous
model should be considered more reliable. Next, we will compare it with
other reliable results for the refractive index of Ta2O5 films.</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../_images/ex_2-7.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Layer material</strong> database contains the <strong>Ta2O5 from T at 300-2000
(IBS)</strong> and <strong>Ta2O5 from T at 400-820 (Magnetron sputtering)</strong> files.
These are well-trusted results from the paper by <strong>A. Tikhonravov et
al., Optical parameters of oxide films typically used in optical coating
production. Appl. Opt., 2011, vol. 50, no. 9, pp. C75-C85</strong><em>.</em> Using
the <strong>Compare Index Plots</strong> option, compare these results with the
<strong>Ta2O5 – inhomogeneous model</strong> file. The difference between our result
and the result obtained for the magnetron sputtered film is almost
indistinguishable. The refractive index of the IBS film from the cited
paper is shifted downwards relative to our result by about 1%. Note that
such difference in the results for the films of the same material
produced using the same deposition processes is quite possible. The
refractive index value is directly related to the density of the
amorphous dielectric film, and the film density can vary depending on
the parameters of the deposition process.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/ex_2-8.png" /></p>
<p>Based on physical considerations, one would only expect an upward or
downward shift of the refractive index wavelength dependencies, as
observed in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window. In the case of dielectric films
and spectral ranges where these films have negligible absorption, there
is no physical reasons for a tilt of one refractive index wavelength
dependence relative to another dependence found for the same material
under different deposition conditions. This fact is important for
comparative verification of characterization results. If such a tilt is
observed relative to well-established results, then the accuracy of the
measured data and the consistency of the film model used should be
checked.</p>
