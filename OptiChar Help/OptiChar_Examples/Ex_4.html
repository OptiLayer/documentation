<h1><strong>LEC24C4 – Using various characterization models</strong></h1>

<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate that is can be useful
to use different models for characterization and compare the results
obtained within these models. The HfO2 film on the fused silica
substrate is used as an example.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C4</strong>. The <strong>Fused silica</strong> substrate datafile needed to run this
exercise and <strong>R &amp; T at 200-1600 nm</strong> measurement datafile are already
loaded into RAM. The <strong>R &amp; T at 200-1600 nm</strong> datafile will be replaced
by other files later after analyzing its accuracy and selecting two
models for optical characterization.</p>
<p>Let us start with the analysis of the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window. In the
<strong>R</strong> tab of this window, we see a good match between the measured
reflectance minima and the substrate reflectance. This allows us to
assume that the film is homogeneous. Let us also check the match in the
<strong>T</strong> tab of the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window. All transmittance maxima are
shifted downwards relative to the transmittance of the uncoated
substrate. The observed shifts are typical for shifts associated with
absorption in the film. Thus, in the further models used for
characterization, we will assume that the film under study is
homogeneous.</p>

<p>To analyze the accuracy of the <strong>R &amp; T at 200-1600 nm</strong> measurement
datafile, select the <strong>Total Losses</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. It
is clear that our film has very strong absorption in the
short-wavelength part of the measurement spectrum. Since the spectral
region near 200 nm is not of primary interest for HfO2 applications, we
will truncate our measurement data to the spectral region starting at
250 nm. This will also allow us to study the total losses in this region
in more detail.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/ex_4-3.png" /></p>
<p>To exclude some of the measurement data, go the
<strong>Preprocess Measurement Data</strong> option from the <strong>Data</strong> menu. In the
<strong>Below</strong> line of the <strong>Measurement Preprocessing</strong> window set 250 and
click <strong>OK</strong>. The measurement data will be truncated to the desired
region.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex_4-4.png" /></p>
<p>An analysis of the graph in the <strong>Total Losses</strong> window gives us the
following. The increase in total losses near the left boundary of the
spectral region is obviously due to the absorption of HfO2 in this
region. The peak in the graph of total losses near 1380 nm should be
attributed to the water absorption peak, associated with the residual
presence of water in the fused silica substrate. But the rather smooth
absorption plateau to the right of 800 nm has no physical explanation.
At 800 nm, the spectrophotometer detectors switch, and it can be assumed
that the measurement accuracy deteriorates. A careful analysis of the
transmittance data near 800 nm shows that there is a sharp jump in the
transmittance at this wavelength. Thus, we come to the following
conclusion: the losses to the right of 800 nm are due to a false
absorption associated with a systematic inaccuracy of the transmittance
data in this spectral region.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusion about the accuracy of transmittance data,
we can use a model including a search for the extinction coefficient
only using the measurement data in the 250-800 nm spectral region. At
the same time, if we want to find only refractive index of the HfO2
film, we can do this in a wider range of 250-1600 nm using only the
reflectance data. This is due to the fact that in the case of dielectric
films, the reflectance is not sensitive to small absorption losses, and
also to its better accuracy in this region.</p>
<p>To summarize, we will perform two characterization attempts using two
different models and different subsets of the available measurement
data. These subsets are stored in the measurement databases under the
names <strong>R and T at 250-800 nm, 8 and 0 degrees</strong> and <strong>R at 250-1600 nm,
8 degrees</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us load the first of the stored subsets and run <strong>Layer
Characterization</strong> with the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong> model for the
refractive index and <strong>UV-VIS</strong> model for the extinction coefficient. An
excellent agreement between the model and measured data is achieved.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_4-5.png" /> <img alt="image5a" src="../_images/ex_4-5a.png" /></p>
<p>The found complex refractive index, i.e. the refractive index and extinction
coefficient, is stored in the <strong>Layer Material</strong> database under the name
<strong>n&amp;k from R,T at 250-800 nm</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_4-6.png" /> <img alt="image6a" src="../_images/ex_4-6a.png" /></p>
<p>Then let us load the second of the stored subsets of the measurement
data and run <strong>Layer Characterization</strong> with the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong>
model for the refractive index and <strong>Non-absorbing</strong> option for the
extinction coefficient. Again, an excellent agreement between the model
and measured data is achieved.</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../_images/ex_4-7.png" /></p>
<p>The found refractive index is stored in
the <strong>Layer Material</strong> database under the name <strong>n from R at 250-1600
nm</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/ex_4-8.png" /></p>
<p>It is worth comparing the refractive indices of the HfO2 film found by
the two characterization attempts using different models and subsets of
measurement data. To do this, select the <strong>Compare Index Plots</strong> option
in the <strong>View</strong> menu. The results obtained are in excellent agreement.
The difference between the refractive indices found by these attempts
does not exceed 0.3%.</p>
