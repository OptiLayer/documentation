<h1><strong>LEC24C3 – Characterization of a dielectric film with small absorption losses</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note</strong> For introduction to the basics of
characterization theory, we recommend the book by A. Tikhonravov,
Optical coatings: design, characterization, monitoring, SPIE Press,
2024</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the determination of
the refractive index and extinction coefficient of a thin film with
small absorption losses. TiO2 film on the Supracil substrate is used as
an example.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C3</strong>. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the <strong>Supracil</strong> substrate and the
measurement datafile <strong>TiO2 R and T data at 400-800 nm</strong>. Open the
<strong>Data Fitting</strong> option in the <strong>View</strong> menu. The dots in the T and R
tabs of this window show the measured transmittance and reflectance
data, respectively. The solid curves in these tabs represent the
transmittance and reflectance from the uncoated BK7 substrate. The
substrate thickness is specified in the <strong>Substrate thickness</strong> line of
the <strong>General Information</strong> window.</p>

<p>As in the previous examples, we start by analyzing the correspondence
between the measured data and the R and T of the uncoated substrate. In
the case of a homogeneous film with a refractive index higher than that
of the uncoated substrate, the measured reflectance minima should match
the reflectance of the uncoated substrate. In the <strong>R</strong> tab of the
<strong>Data Fitting</strong> window, we see a perfect match between these minima and
the substrate reflectance. This fact indicates that the film is
homogeneous.</p>
<p>Let us now check the fit in the <strong>T</strong> tab of the <strong>Data Fitting</strong>
window. We see that all transmittance maxima are shifted downwards
relative to the transmittance of the uncoated substrate. But the
wavelength dependence of these shifts is not typical for shifts caused
by film inhomogeneity, which are almost the same for all wavelength
positions of the transmittance maxima. On the contrary, the observed
shifts are typical for shifts associated with absorption in the film.
The latter usually increase at shorter wavelengths, where absorption
increases. Thus, the observed downward shift of the transmittance maxima
from the substrate transmittance should be attributed to the absorption
of the film.</p>
<p>Based on the above considerations, we must conclude that it is necessary
to use a model of a homogenous film that has some absorption. But before
finally choosing a thin film model, let us perform one more useful
experiment. Let us go to the Total losses option in the View menu. This
option displays the wavelength dependence of the difference 100% - R%
-T%, where R and T are the measured reflectance and transmittance data.
In principle, to calculate the total losses in the studied film, it is
necessary to have R and T data measured at the same angle of incidence.
However, it is typical for spectrophotometers in use today to measure
these data at slightly different angles, which are usually zero for T
and a few degrees for R. Since the difference between R (or T) values
measured at incidence angles differing by a few degrees is not very
significant, the Total losses option allows using T and R data measured
at slightly different angles.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex_3-4.png" /></p>
<p>In our case, the R data was measured at 8 degrees of incidence, and the
T data was measured at normal incidence. This difference in incidence
angles causes small fluctuations in the total losses plot displayed,
which is not significant for the main conclusion that follows from
analyzing this plot. This conclusion is that the film is absorbing, with
the typical exponential decrease in absorption from the UV to Visible
spectral range for dielectric films.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to use the <strong>Layer Characterization</strong> option in the
<strong>Characterization</strong> menu. Let us select the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong>
(three-parameter Cauchy model) for the refractive index and <strong>UV-VIS</strong>
model for the extinction coefficient. Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the
characterization procedure. The results displayed in the <strong>Data
Fitting</strong> window show an excellent agreement between the model and
measured data.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_3-5.png" /> <img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_3-6.png" /></p>
<p>The found wavelength dependencies of the refractive index
and extinction coefficient can be seen in the corresponding tabs of the
<strong>Layer Plots</strong> window. They are saved in the <strong>Layer material</strong>
database under the name <strong>TiO2 from R and T data at 400-800 nm</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/ex_3-8.png" /> <img alt="image8a" src="../_images/ex_3-8a.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Important note:</strong> For dielectric thin films, there is a little point
in searching for the extinction coefficient if only R data is available,
since this data is not sensitive to the small absorption in the
dielectric films. In principle, it is possible to search for the
extinction coefficient if only T data is available, but for the most
reliable results it is always better to have both transmittance and
reflectance measurement data.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the end of this exercise, let us verify the found TiO2 refractive
index wavelength dependence versus well-established TiO2 refractive
index dependencies. In the <strong>Layer material</strong> database, there are two
such dependencies from the paper by <strong>A. Tikhonravov et al., Optical
parameters of oxide films typically used in optical coating production.
Appl. Opt., 2011, vol. 50, no. 9, pp. C75-C85</strong><em>.</em> These are datafiles
<strong>TiO2 (IBS)</strong> and <strong>TiO2 (e-beam)</strong> that were obtained for the films
produced using IBS and e-beam evaporation processes.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Compare Index Plots</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. From
physical considerations, one would only expect an upward or downward
shift in the refractive index wavelength dependencies due to the
difference in density of thin films of the same material obtained under
different deposition conditions. That is what we see in the comparison
window. This gives us confidence in the correctness of the results
obtained.</p>
