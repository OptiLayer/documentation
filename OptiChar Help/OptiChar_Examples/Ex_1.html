<h1><strong>LEC24C1 – Refractive index of SiO2 on BK7 substrate</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note:</strong> The main theoretical facts needed to solve this
characterization problem are presented in the text below. For a more
detailed introduction to the basics of characterization theory, we
recommend the book by A. Tikhonravov, Optical coatings: design,
characterization, monitoring, SPIE Press, 2024</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the determination of
the refractive index of a thin film with noticeable bulk inhomogeneity.
The example presents the methodology of optical characterization using
spectral photometric data. We consider SiO2 film deposited on the BK7
substrate.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C1</strong>. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate <strong>BK7</strong> and the layer measured
reflectance datafile <strong>R data at 350-840 nm</strong>.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Data Fitting</strong>
option in the <strong>View</strong> menu. Dots in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window show
measured reflectance data, and the solid curve represents the
reflectance from the uncoated BK7 substrate. Substrate thickness is set
in the line <strong>Substrate Thickness</strong> of the General Information window.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex_1-2.png" /></p>
<p>There are some very simple but extremely useful theoretical facts that
should be taken into consideration when defining a layer model for
characterization using spectral reflectance data.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>If the considered film is non-absorbing, has no bulk inhomogeneity
across the film thickness, and its refractive index is lower than the
refractive index of the substrate (this is our case), then the
measured reflectance maxima should coincide with the reflectance of
the uncoated substrate.</p></li>
<li><p>If the film has bulk inhomogeneity, then the reflectance maxima will
be shifted relative to the reflectance of the uncoated substrate.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of dielectric materials, a small extinction coefficient
(the imaginary part of the complex refractive index) has little
effect on the reflectance of the film.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window we see that the reflectance maxima are
shifted downwards relative to the reflectance of the uncoated substrate.
In principle, a downward shift of the R and T spectral data can be
related to absorption in a film. We are now investigating a SiO2 film,
which is known to have only a small extinction coefficient. Thus,
according to fact 3, we cannot attribute the observed shift to
absorption. Therefore, according to fact 2, we should expect that our
film has bulk inhomogeneity.</p>
<p>However, we will start our investigation with a model of a homogeneous
thin film. This will allow us to see what happens if we choose
inappropriate film model. Go to the <strong>Characterization -&gt; Layer
Characterization</strong> menu item. The layer model is specified by choosing
models for the refractive index and extinction coefficient.</p>
<p>Let us choose the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong> model. This is a three-parameter Cauchy
model for the refractive index, which usually works well for dielectric
films in the Near UV-Visible-Near IR spectral regions. The fourth
unknown parameter of our model will be the thickness of the investigated
film. It will be searched for in accordance with the <strong>Lower and Upper
Limits</strong> set at the top of the window. Based on the above discussion, we
set <strong>Non-absorbing</strong> model in the <strong>Extinction</strong> field.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/ex_1-3.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the characterization procedure. Its results are
displayed in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> and <strong>Layer Plots</strong> windows. The
latter shows the refractive index found during the procedure. The found
refractive index is stored in the <strong>Layer Material</strong> database under the
name <strong>SiO2 – homogeneous model</strong>. Pay attention to the <strong>Data Fitting</strong>
window. There are significant deviations in the reflectance of our model
(solid curve) from the measured data. This is due to the fact that we
use an inappropriate layer model. Within the selected model, the
reflectance maxima coincide with the reflectance of the uncoated
substrate and they simply cannot fit the measured data around their
maxima.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Important note:</strong> Systematic deviations of the model’s spectral
characteristics from the measured data usually indicate deficiencies in
the thin film model.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Let us move on to the <strong>Layer Refinement</strong> option of the
<strong>Characterization</strong> menu. It will allow us to specify a model
accounting for bulk inhomogeneity of our film. Note that this option has
default models for the refractive index and extinction coefficient taken
from the <strong>Layer Characterization</strong> option. To take into account the
bulk inhomogeneity, simply check the <strong>Bulk</strong> checkbox in the lower left
part of the window. The bulk inhomogeneity will be searched for within
the so-called Schroeder’s model, which assumes a liner change (increase
or decrease) in the refractive index of the film from its rear boundary
to the front boundary.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_1-5.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the refinement procedure. The results are also
displayed in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> and <strong>Layer Plots</strong> windows. The
<strong>Data Fitting</strong> window shows a much better fit of the measured data
than before. The refractive index wavelength dependence has decreased
compared to the result obtained using the homogeneous film model. This
is in better agreement with the known SiO2 refractive index wavelength
dependencies.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_1-6.png" /> <img alt="image7" src="../_images/ex_1-7.png" /></p>
<p>The degree of inhomogeneity is found to be positive (see
<strong>General Information</strong> window -&gt;<strong>Layer</strong>), meaning that the
refractive index increases from the back boundary of the film to the
front boundary. Such an increase is quite common for films produced
using high energetic deposition processes. The degree of inhomogeneity
is expressed as a percentage of its relative change compared to its mean
value.</p>
