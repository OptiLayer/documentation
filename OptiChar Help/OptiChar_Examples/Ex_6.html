<h1><strong>LEC24C6 – Substrate characterization (ZnSe substrate)</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note</strong> It is worth explaining to users that substrate
characterization may only be required in very special and rare
situations. Typically, characterization uses substrates from well-known
suppliers, and substrate refractive indices and extinction coefficients
are already known with very high accuracy. There is no point in finding
substrate parameters from spectrophotometric measurements of their
transmittance and reflectance, since it is virtually impossible to
obtain substrate parameters with greater accuracy than those provided by
the suppliers.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The example considered here pertains to just such a special situation.
It is necessary to find the refractive index and extinction coefficient of a ZnSe substrate for which only
very limited information is available. The main reference for these data is the publication by Connolly et. al.,
Specifications of Raytran material, Proc. SPIE, 181, 141-144, 1979.
Unfortunately, it contains data on the refractive index of ZnSe starting only at 540 nm,
and it does not contain any data related to the extinction coefficient of ZnSe.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C6</strong>. There are three measurement datafiles named <strong>400-800 nm,
one side R data</strong>, <strong>400-800 nm, T data</strong>, <strong>and 800-2500 nm, one side R
data</strong>. There is also another file named <strong>800-2500 nm, one side R data
without 890-940 nm band</strong>, the contents of which will be explained
later. The data files whose names contain “one side R data” contain
reflectance data measured on a wedged ZnSe substrate to eliminate the
influence of reflection from the substrate back side. Reflectance
measurements were made at 8 degrees incidence. The second datafile
contains normal incidence transmittance data. The measurement ranges are
indicated in the datafile names.</p>
<p>Load the measurement datafile <strong>400-800 nm, one side R data</strong> and check
the checkbox <strong>Reflectance without back side</strong> in the <strong>General
Information</strong> window. Go to the <strong>Substrate Characterization</strong> mode of
the <strong>Characterization</strong> menu. The Data Fitting window show a
non-monotonic dependence of the reflectance on the wavelength, which
suggests a rather complex dependence of the refractive index on the
wavelength.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex_6-1.png" /></p>
<p>For this reason, we will select the <strong>n(lambda)</strong> model in
the <strong>Substrate Characterization Setup</strong> window. Let us first use the
default <strong>Smooth</strong> setting of the <strong>Re(n)</strong> slider on the right side the
Setup window.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex_6-2.png" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button. The agreement between the model and the
measured data is poor. Apparently, too high requirements for the
smoothness of the substrate refractive index were applied. Check the
obtained substrate refractive index in the <strong>Substrate Plots</strong> window.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/ex_6-3.png" /> <img alt="image3a" src="../_images/ex_6-3a.png" /></p>
<p>Go back to the Substrate characterization and reduce the requirement for
the refractive index smoothness by moving the Smooth slider down two
steps. Click <strong>OK</strong>. The agreement between the model and the measured
data is better, but still poor at shorter wavelengths.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex_6-4.png" /></p>
<p>Go back to the
Substrate characterization and further reduce the requirement for the
refractive index smoothness by moving the Smooth slider down three
steps. Click <strong>OK</strong>. Now a fairly good agreement is achieved between the
model and the measured data.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_6-5.png" /></p>
<p>The found non-monotonic dependence of the
substrate refractive index on wavelength is presented in the <strong>Substrate
Plots</strong> window. It is stored in the <strong>Substrate</strong> database under the
name <strong>ZnSe at 400-800 nm - n(lambda) model</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image5a" src="../_images/ex_6-5a.png" /></p>
<p>Load the <strong>800-2500 nm, one side R data</strong> measurement datafile. Go to
the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window in the <strong>View</strong> menu and notice that the
data in the spectral region around 900 nm was clearly measured with
errors.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_6-6.png" /></p>
<p>Use the <strong>Modify Measurement</strong> option and remove the measurement
data in the spectral region from 890 to 940 nm. The corrected datafile
is stored under the name <strong>800-2500 nm, one side R data without 890-940
nm band</strong>. Go to the Substrate characterization and use <strong>n(lambda)</strong>
model with the default setting for the <strong>Smooth</strong> slider. Check the
substrate refractive index in the Substrate Plots window. It has too
many small variations, which means it is worth increasing the
requirements for the refractive index smoothness.</p>
<p><img alt="image6a" src="../_images/ex_6-6a.png" /></p>
<p>Move the slider in the
<strong>Substrate Characterization Setup</strong> window three steps higher and run
the substrate characterization again. The obtained refractive index is
smoother. It is stored in the <strong>Substrate</strong> database under the name
<strong>ZnSe at 800-2500 nm - n(lambda) model</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../_images/ex_6-7.png" /></p>
<p>Check the agreement between the ZnSe refractive indices found from the
400-800 nm range data and the 800-2500 nm range data at 800nm. The index
values at this wavelength are almost identical: they differ by less than
0.1%.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/ex_6-8.png" /></p>
<p>The results can be combined in a single ZnSe index file for the
400-2500 nm spectral region. This combined index file is stored under
the name <strong>ZnSe at 400-2500 nm - combined data</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us look at the absorption in the substrate. We have a datafile
<strong>400-800 nm, T data</strong> with the transmittance data measured in the
spectral region of 400-800 nm. So, we can try to find the extinction
coefficient of the ZnSe substrate. Let us load the datafile <strong>400-800
nm, T data</strong> into RAM.</p>
<p><img alt="image10" src="../_images/ex_6-10.png" /></p>
<p>We see that the substrate completely absorbs
below 480 nm. So, we can search for the extinction coefficient only in
the spectral region starting from 480 nm. To do this, load the substrate
refractive index <strong>ZnSe at 400-800 nm: n(lambda) model</strong> and append the
reflectance datafile <strong>400-800 nm, one side R data</strong> to the already
loaded transmittance data. Go to the <strong>Preprocess Measurement Data</strong>
option in the <strong>Data</strong> menu and truncate all measurement data below 480
nm.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Substrate Characterization Setup</strong> window, select the
<strong>Loaded</strong> model for the refractive index and the <strong>UV-VIS</strong> model for
the extinction coefficient. Check that the <strong>Upper Limit</strong> for the
extinction coefficient is not less than 0.1.</p>
<p><img alt="image11" src="../_images/ex_6-11.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to run
Substrate characterization. The discrepancy value decreases to 0.87. The
obtained refractive index and extinction coefficient are stored in the
datafile <strong>ZnSe with absorption at 480-800 nm</strong>.</p>
