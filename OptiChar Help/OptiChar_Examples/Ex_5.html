<h1><strong>LEC24C5 – Characterization using spectral ellipsometric data</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note:</strong> The main theoretical facts concerning optical
characterization using spectral ellipsometric data are presented in the
text below. For a more detailed introduction to the basics of
characterization theory, we recommend the book by A. Tikhonravov,
Optical coatings: design, characterization, monitoring, SPIE Press,
2024</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of this example is to demonstrate the application of
spectroscopic ellipsometry to the determination of optical parameters of
thin films and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this type
of optical characterization compared to the more widely used
spectrophotometric characterization.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Project</strong> menu of OptiChar, open the directory
<strong>LEC24C5</strong>. The datafiles needed to run this exercise are already
loaded into RAM. These are the substrate <strong>Fused silica</strong> and the
measurement datafile <strong>Nb2O5 ELL. 65 DEG</strong>. The downloaded measurement
datafile contains Psi and Delta ellipsometric data measured in the
400-850 nm wavelength range at 65-degrees incidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note</strong>: In addition to the measured Psi and Delat angles,
ellipsometric datafiles typically contain tolerances for the measured
Psi and Delta values, which are determined during the ellipsometric
measurements and imported from instrument files at the same time as the
ellipsometric angle data.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Open the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. The dots in the
<strong>Psi</strong> and <strong>Delta</strong> tabs of the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window show the
measured ellipsometric data, and the solid curves represent the
ellipsometric angles for the uncoated fused silica substrate.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/ex_5-1.png" /> <img alt="image1a" src="../_images/ex_5-1a.png" /></p>
<p>The following theoretical considerations are important for
characterization using spectral ellipsometric data. In the case of
low-absorbing dielectric materials, the extinction coefficient (the
imaginary part of the complex refractive index) has little effect on the
film reflection coefficient. Both ellipsometric angles are expressed in
terms of the reflection coefficients for the s- and p-polarized light.
For this reason, low absorption has only a minor effect on both
ellipsometric angles. <strong>Therefore, there is a little point in trying to
determine extinction coefficients using ellipsometric data</strong>.</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Layer Characterization</strong> option in the <strong>Characterization</strong>
menu and select the <strong>Normal Dispersion</strong> model for the refractive index
and the <strong>Non-absorbing</strong> model for the extinction coefficient as per
the note above. Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the characterization procedure.
The results are displayed in the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> and <strong>Layer Plots</strong>
windows. Check the fit of the model data to the measured data in the
<strong>Psi</strong> tab of the <strong>Data Fitting</strong> window.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/ex_5-2.png" /></p>
<p>Systematic deviations of the
model Psi angle from the measured data are observed. It is worth keeping
in mind that <strong>systematic deviations of the model spectral
characteristics from the measured data usually indicate deficiencies in
the thin film model</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image4" src="../_images/ex_5-4.png" /></p>
<p>As with spectral photometric data, there are important theoretical
results for spectral ellipsometric that help to understand which thin
film model to consider. In 1990, Chuck Carniglia introduced two types of
wavelength points: half-wave (HW) and quarter-wave (QW) points. He made
the following conclusions about the effect of thin film inhomogeneity on
ellipsometric data:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ellipsometric angle Ψ is most sensitive to bulk
inhomogeneity at HW points.</p></li>
<li><p>Ellipsometric angle Ψ is insensitive to bulk inhomogeneity
at QW points.</p></li>
<li><p>Ellipsometric angle Δ is insensitive to bulk inhomogeneity
at HW and QW points.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can mark these points using the <strong>HW, QW, IW Points</strong> section of the
<strong>Options…</strong> menu item in the <strong>Characterization</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/ex_5-6.png" /></p>
<p>Let us check
the <strong>HW</strong> points first, and then the <strong>QW</strong> points. We see that, as
Chuck Carniglia predicted, the greatest discrepancy between the model
and measured data is at the <strong>HW</strong> points, while at the <strong>QW</strong> points
there is a good agreement between the two. The obvious conclusion is
that the film under study is inhomogeneous.</p>
<p><img alt="image7" src="../_images/ex_5-7.png" /> <img alt="image7a" src="../_images/ex_5-7a.png" /></p>
<p>Let us move on to the <strong>Layer Refinement</strong> option of the
<strong>Characterization</strong> menu and include the bulk inhomogeneity in the thin
film model. To do this, simply check the <strong>Bulk</strong> checkbox in the lower
left part of the window. The bulk inhomogeneity will be searched for
within the so-called Schroeder’s model, which assumes a liner change
(increase or decrease) in the refractive index of the film from its rear
boundary to the front boundary.</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start the refinement procedure. The <strong>Data Fitting</strong>
window shows a much better match of the measured data than before. There
is excellent agreement between the model and measured data at both the
<strong>HW</strong> and <strong>QW</strong> points. But there is still a noticeable discrepancy at
the wavelengths just between these points.</p>
<p><img alt="image8" src="../_images/ex_5-8.png" /> <img alt="image8a" src="../_images/ex_5-8a.png" /></p>
<p>Recall that systematic deviations of the model data from the measured
data may indicate the imperfection of the thin film model used. Again,
it is necessary to involve another theoretical result related to the
effect of the film surface roughness on the ellipsometric angles.
Tikhonravov et. al. showed that the presence of a surface overlayer on a
top of a thin film most noticeably affects the ellipsometric angle
Ψ at the <strong>IW</strong> points located just between the <strong>HW</strong> and <strong>QW</strong>
points. This is exactly what we observe in the Data Fitting window (we
can mark the <strong>IW</strong> points using the <strong>HW, QW, IW Points</strong> section of
the <strong>Options…</strong> menu item in the <strong>Characterization</strong> menu). Thus, it
is advisable to add another parameter to the thin film model, namely the
thickness of the overlayer representing the surface roughness. This
overlayer has an intermediate refractive index between the film index
and ambient medium index.</p>
<p>Return to the <strong>Layer Refinement</strong> option of the <strong>Characterization</strong>
menu and check the <strong>Surface</strong> checkbox at the bottom of the setup
window.</p>
<p><img alt="image5" src="../_images/ex_5-5.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to run the refinement procedure. The <strong>Data
Fitting</strong> window now shows an excellent match between the model and
measured <strong>Psi</strong> data across the entire measurement spectrum. The found
degree of inhomogeneity and the surface overlayer thickness can be seen
in the <strong>General Information</strong> window.</p>
<p><img alt="image10" src="../_images/ex_5-10.png" /></p>
<p>The refractive index wavelength
plot is shown in the <strong>Layer Plots</strong> window. The results are stored in
the <strong>Layer Material</strong> database under the name <strong>NbO5 from 65-degree
data</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="image11" src="../_images/ex_5-11.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="image9" src="../_images/arrow_r.png" /> <strong>Note</strong>: The thickness of the overlayer representing the surface
roughness is found to be only slightly more than 1 nm.
Spectrophotometric data are not sensitive to the surface overlayers of
such small thickness. Therefore, ellipsometric measurements have
advantages in studying the surface roughness of thin films. At the same
time, it should be borne in mind that there is a little point in using
ellipsometric data to determine small extinction coefficients of
dielectric films. Spectrophotometric data of both reflection and
transmission should be used for such determination.</p>
