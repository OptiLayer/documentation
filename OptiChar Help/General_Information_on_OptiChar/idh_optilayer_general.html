<div class="line">OptiLayer software family covers all steps of the design
manufacturing cycle. It consists of three main modules:
OptiLayer (design and evaluation), OptiChar (optical
characterization of a single thin film), OptiRE (post-production
characterization of multilayers and reverse engineering). All
modules are compatible on the database level and can easily
exchange data.</div>
<div class="line">OptiLayer software uses multithreaded computations. This allows
the user to interact with the software (input data, edit data,
prepare reports, etc.) without interrupting computations. All
programs of the OptiLayer software family have convenient
user-friendly interface with independent desktop windows. The
user will entirely recognize the convenience of this feature
when discovering potentialities of multithreaded computations or
using other applications in parallel with OptiLayer. Live real
time graphics is used to reflect all computational processes.
This makes design, analysis, and characterization processes
vivid and significantly increases the user’s ability to monitor
and control software operation.</div>
<div class="line">You are running OptiChar - a powerful software tool to support
the optical characterization of thin films. This computer
program was developed by Prof. Alexander Tikhonravov and Dr.
Michael Trubetskov.</div>
<div class="line">OptiChar is a computer program for the characterization of thin
films based on spectral photometric and ellipsometric data.
This program is a part of a family of programs to support thin
film analysis, design, and manufacture.  It combines a novel
approach based on a new and unique set of mathematical
algorithms with an advanced menu structure, commands and user
interface that make the program extremely powerful research
tool.</div>
<div class="line">The program provides various options enable the user to
conveniently exchange data with other programs of the OptiLayer
software family and to facilitate the import of measurement data
from various measurement devices. The program also has a
software utility that allows the extraction of numerical data
from any ASCII file.  This utility makes OptiChar compatible
with other commercial thin film packages or with the user’s own
software.</div>
<div class="line">OptiChar utilizes the most up-to-date software decisions that
make it extremely convenient in use. Along with its own specific
options it provides a variety of the most essential standard
windows options. Due to a carefully elaborated interface the
user can easily start managing the program with the minimal
references to the User’s Guide. Not to overload the text with
the well known details the User’s Guide concentrates on the
specific options of the program.  Standard Windows options are
considered in less detail.</div>
